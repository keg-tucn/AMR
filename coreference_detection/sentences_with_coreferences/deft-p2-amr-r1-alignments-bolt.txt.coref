After its competitor invented the front loading washing machine , the CEO of the American IM company believed that each of its employees had the ability for innovation , and formulated strategic countermeasures for innovation in the industry .

2. Choose 100 innovative concepts to encourage employees to conduct research and development during their work time or spare time .

3. From among them , pick out 50 for submission to an assessment committee to assess .

Since the Tangshan Earthquake , the starting point for construction standards in the mainland is that under an earthquake of the same magnitude , buildings should preserve their basic frame without collapsing .

Raising standards to in excess of Tangshan 's 8.0 magnitude could leave authorities with some breathing space for explanation , and alleviate public anger .

Although current forecasting standards cannot give us an accurate prediction of the exact time , place , and strength of an earthquake , there is considerable experience accumulated both in China and overseas in predicting to within the timeframe of a month , and the area of a province .

In regions where the earthquake risk is high , warning the public and spreading disaster prevention awareness could greatly reduce casualties during earthquakes ; this is the very minimum duty that any responsible government should undertake .

In the past the CCP has done a lot of these sorts of things , but on this occasion not only did nothing , but in response to queries from the public pulled out some whopping lies , playing syntax games with words like " geological disaster " and " earthquake disaster ".

I think that if our Earthquake Administration had been able beforehand to do a simulation of big earthquakes on this Longmenshan mountain earthquake belt , then on that day of May 12 , once the Earthquake Administration had measured the quake at a magnitude of 7.8 , we would have been able to broadly judge the extent of damage and destruction in the earthquake disaster zone .

Instead in this instance the Liberation Army headquarters emergency contingency plan obviously was not a contingency plan designed with earthquakes as the assumed condition , as the soldiers all rushed straight to Wenchuan , without immediately sending out troops in the direction of badly @-@ hit areas Beichuan , Qingchuan and Gansu 's Longnan ; only 24 hours later was the full extent of the disaster area taken into consideration .

In addition , the breakdown in communication also brought a serious problem to the surface . In the past , Red Army regiments were able to maintain contact with central headquarters by relying on just one battered radio . On this occasion though , people had no way to deal with the communication failure .

While it should have been a disaster relief command that takes overall leadership , it has suddenly come face @-@ to @-@ face with the broad base of disaster victims , directly dealing with them .

The lack or serious shortage of intermediate layers of Party organizations and units between the two has resulted in its inability to consider major issues with endless minor issues on hand , such that even if it is highly capable , it won't last long , as it will be dragged down by numerous petty things .

This would have been unimaginable during the Great Tangshan Earthquake . A time without volunteers or mental workers , such petty things as directly dealing with average people were performed by the most primary Party branches , as well as enterprises and public institutions .

As soon as the earthquake occurred , grass @-@ root organizations contacted their own people and average people also contacted their own systems or departments , in an interdependent manner .

Under the centralized leadership of higher @-@ level organizations , everyone acted to make the rescue efforts very outstanding and successful , such that the Great Tangshan Earthquake , which happened just a few years ago , was forgotten all together in the subsequent reform and opening @-@ up .

It is obvious that no social or political problems were left then , nor were sequelae that cause headaches to later generations .

But it was not totally without benefits , and I believe that its greatest benefit was that it served to strip off the false benevolence that composed the outer skin of the elitists , the politicians , the capitalists , and exposed once and for all the rotten cannibalistic core within .

And an additional benefit was that many people who had been deluded came to their senses .

The experts had just finished saying " Sacrificing yourself to help others is a foolish idea ", when the leaders had no choice but to call once again for selfless devotion .

This was mere chicanery , to the point where before engaging in life @-@ saving , donation to charity , these sorts of behaviors , an idea had to be flashing through people 's minds :

Am I being foolish in doing this ?

And when people saw on CCTV those private firms manufacturing tents in Jiangsu and Zhejiang working overtime to produce more tents , the first idea that popped to mind I 'm afraid was probably " This time these capitalists have struck it big ! "

" Why is it that these capitalists instead of those capitalists get the big order forms , surely there could n't be anything fishy involved ?

The reason for filing the complaint is that even if we owed their hourly fees , they still should fulfill their obligation on the contract they signed : driving people from Canberra back to Sydney .

As long as we stick to this issue , Xinghui surely has no way of winning the lawsuit if it goes to court .

However , what greatly surprised me was the attitude of the student union in this appeal . They seemed very reluctant to make the contract public .

They even lied , saying that they and Xinghui initially felt that signing a contract would rather make each other feel like strangers since they were both doing it for the sake of the motherland .

Xinghui accepted this order of ours and deployed all the buses of other travel agencies in Sydney .

Without the guarantee from the contract signed with us , they would surely have been unable to deploy them !

I heard from a friend at the consulate that the government took this matter very seriously and had promptly agreed to allocate funds to compensate the students who had used their own money instead that night .

Yesterday afternoon I went back to check out the torch relay , but even the flame was practically impossible to see , let alone the guys carrying the torch .

Some guys were really insane , banding together in groups and yelling out " Go China ! "

I actually had some other classmates there , and was going to call them .

I guessed the carrying capacity of the base station towers was totally overloaded , and I could n't get through at all . I was only able to find a signal , not a chance of connecting to the Internet .

Only one phone call I made there got through - that was calling home .

I had a look at my call register , and out of dozens of calls dialed only one was properly connected !

Sometime after 6 I went straight back home to watch it on TV . The spectacle was just as astonishing on TV , except that it was just one angle of the whole thing .

Wang Shi 's experience of being under public condemnation underscored to a certain extent the tense relationship between the rich and poor classes in Chinese society ;

because as China grows prosperous day by day , the gap of wealth between the successful elite and the remaining 1.3 billion people is widening .

However , Hurun Report ( Hurun Report ) shows that by 2007 , there were a total of 106 billionaires ( in U.S. dollars ) in China , with the number of people only next to that of the United States .

Now , Wang Shi said , these responses have had effects on me .

He admitted that he was not sensitive enough to the current situation when he wrote his blog .

Wang Shi noted additionally that since China currently has not yet established a sound system of social security insurance , the growing hatred of the rich is unavoidable .

On Tuesday , Wanke announced that it would make an additional donation of RMB 100 million yuan for the temporary resettlement and post @-@ disaster reconstruction in the next three to five years .

Yao Ming , the basketball player who was hailed as a national hero thanks to his success in establishing himself in NBA , was also blamed after he announced his donation of RMB two million yuan because a rumor on the Internet alleged he had donated one million U.S. dollars for disaster relief of Hurricane Katrina ( Hurricane ) in 2005 .

Even so , donation behavior and the treatment of donation behavior should not deviate from two principles , namely that it is voluntary and does not seek return . Otherwise , the donation loses its original meaning .

In actual fact , whether it is McDonalds or any other foreign owned enterprises in China on the so @-@ called " international iron rooster " blacklist , they all gave generously to the cause of helping the disaster victims , exhibiting their social responsibility .

Even if by comparison some companies really did n't donate a huge amount , they should not be besieged or subjected to verbal violence in the arena of public opinion .

Donating , after all , is not a legal obligation that companies must carry out . Urging businesses to donate apart from the force of moral considerations should not take the form of any other coercive means .

As long as a company 's source of income is legal , any compulsory payment outside of legal obligations is a kind of theft .

If we are unfortunate enough to be unable to avoid becoming a disaster victim , we can at least preserve the nobility and dignity of humanity and not turn into rabble .

The lawsuit proposed by Hai Ming did not have a clear subject of the right of action ; moreover it did not satisfy the legal requirement for libel .

For example , he failed to clarify whether Cafferty 's comment was an argument over opinions or an act of spreading an untruthful statement .

The malicious intent of Cafferty has not been established , either . More importantly , he has been unable to offer anything as to how to establish the damage to the 1.3 billion Chinese people .

In addition , in his complaint , it is said that Chinese people have already expressed their displeasure through demonstrations .

On the issue of libel , courts only support those who have actually suffered damages and have no other way to seek justice .

Therefore , it is very hard for the government , politicians , and public figures to get legal protection on the issue of libel ,

because they have the capability to clear themselves of " smears ."

If you have already cleared your own reputation through legal protests , for example , Chinese people are not goons and thugs , then a lawsuit is meaningless .

Remember , a lawsuit for libel is only to clear your name and get compensation .

Because they have no understanding whatsoever of the situation in Taiwan and the will of the Taiwan people ,

Just like the love @-@ hate fusion of nationalistic war sentiment that erupted after the US mistakenly bombed the Chinese embassy .

But Hong Kong people realize that first there was the Republic of China , only after that came " New China ";

Lee Teng @-@ hui was doing nothing but bringing an already existing phenomenon to light .

Moreover , the grand old men of the CCP who handed over on a silver platter a huge chunk of land in Manchuria north of the Amur River to Soviet Russia , who gave away land equivalent to ten percent of national territory in northern Mongolia ; why not take this back , instead of insisting on trying to grab back a Taiwan that remains in the hands of Chinese people ?

However , even though Hong Kong people have their grumbles , the " two states theory " has in no way triggered a sentimental attachment in Hong Kong people for " Old China ".

Not only has the law not yet reached this level , but the average person 's understanding has generally not reached this level .

Some officials , out of local economic considerations , by accident or design are frequently too lenient in dealing with property agents .

We all saw the damage wreaked by the Wenchuan Earthquake .

As to how much of this was a result of natural disaster , and how much was man @-@ made calamity , a verdict will be drawn in the end .

Even such technologically advanced nations as the US have experienced several instances of space flight launch or return failures .

Since things can still go wrong even when they are subjected to incredibly rigorous inspections as in the space industry , then , with our current " dark " and corrupt property industry the way it is , people 's lives are even harder to place guarantees on .

It makes one tremble even without fear .

Following the Great Wenchuan Earthquake this time , there were compatriots who struggled out of the debris , wiped their tears and buried the bodies of their families , but they braced up again and declared to the world , " we are not beaten down ; we are on our feet again ; the earthquake cannot shake the staunch will of the Chinese people ; trials and tribulations serve only to revitalize a nation ! "

This enables us to see the fighting spirits of the dauntless Chinese nation give off a dazzling radiance among people in disaster @-@ hit areas .

The fact that these words are spoken by compatriots who have been through the disaster has given us , who could n't help our tears at the sight of their mishaps , so much comfort and encouragement . It gives us a hint that no force can beat down the Chinese people .

However , the words later reappeared somewhere else and from someone unusual , which I thought about for a few days . I feel , for some unknown reason , it is somewhat scary !

I just want to say , let there be no more disasters , so that China is safe and sound from now on and disasters are far away from China .

I pray to the God to open his eyes and do n't let disasters visit the Chinese land again !

We do n't want to revitalize the nation through trials and tribulations ,

but rather we want to revitalize the nation by passing our days safe and sound !

One important reason that a great number of people buried or trapped in debris in the Wenchuan earthquake @-@ hit area were saved is that they were full of hopes and firmly believed the PLA would come to their rescue !

Tens of thousands or even millions of those displaced by the disaster have gradually had a home to shelter from the wind and rain !

Supporting the disaster @-@ hit areas has tested our competence , while the government 's ability to rule also stood the trial !

If everything were put in the market , such that workers and farmers would have their fates controlled by the market and no longer count on or rely on the government by walking onto a path of the so @-@ called " finding the market rather than the mayor ( government ) ," then what power would the government have ?

" Sing a song when thou have wine , seize the day since life is short." Some people in contemporary times think we should " satisfy and die ."

Some people have gone so far on the road that they " don't know how to eat or play , "

and other take nude pictures and flaunt them online .

In ancient times there was Zhou Li to distinguish the order of hierarchy and nobility , constructing a pyramid @-@ like social organizational structure .

The son of the Heaven wore different clothes than others . The color of a door and the number of caldrons used for meals were all symbols to distinguish the hierarchy and nobility of people .

However , simultaneously it has also established a system that values life according to office levels , which to the contrary triggered contentions and destabilized the society .

Higher or lower ranks in Qing Dynasty were distinguished by bird and animal patterns on clothes , Taiping Heavenly Kingdom used the size and color of a sedan chair as the symbol to distinguish between different ranks , and modern people use the motor vehicle displacement as a symbol to distinguish between different positions , all of which can be traced to the same origin .

I do n't care how much Wang Shi wastes every time he climbs a mountain , but I do strongly despise how he talks and the way he acts during this whole thing .

After donating , he suggested that charity should not be the burden of businesses , and therefore stipulated that his company 's employee donations should not exceed 10 yuan .

Totally absurd logic . Wang Shi 's reasoning is that making donations to charities then the burden of businesses could cause companies to fail in market competition ;

But we can see such philanthropists as Bill Gates , Li Ka @-@ shing , Jackie Chan have not affected the growth of their enterprises in any way . Instead , they have actually increased the competitiveness of their companies .

And there were some netizens who hit back in the Wang Shi donations issue by admonishing us for forcing donations on moral grounds .

If you say that netizens rebuking Wang Shi is forcing donations , then what kind of behavior is Wang Shi preventing employees from donating more than 10 yuan ?

but how come Wang Shi , how come he wants to restrict what employees do or do n't do on moral grounds ?

We see , as at May 17 , the Chinese government has accepted up to 6 billion in disaster @-@ relief donations domestically and internationally , of which 4.8 billion is from domestic donors .

What we can see now are merely the name and figure of each donor constantly listed in what is like an honor roll .

Yet unfortunately , we do n't have more detailed information of the whereabouts and specific uses of the donated funds .

As corruption has long been prevalent among local governments and economic auditing is not transparent enough , disaster @-@ relief funds are often appropriated , exhausted , expropriated and embezzled .

Therefore , once such a huge amount of disaster @-@ relief funds from people the world and China are embezzled or otherwise partially transferred by local officials , the resulting political damage and lowering of the government 's image domestically and internationally will completely negate the positive image brought by the government 's disaster @-@ relief efforts .

If the donations are directly put in the hands of disaster @-@ hit people , it would push local prices higher , driving the already high inflation to a direction that is even harder to regulate .

So , we again hear expert figures emphasizing once again , " Earthquake forecasts are a global challenge that so far no one has been able to solve ."

Consequently , we come to realize that the academic laurels for " the success rates of predictions of impending earthquakes that have already reached almost 40 %" are just conditions and capital used to apply for funding , evaluate professional titles and seek remuneration , rather than a hard rationale used to reduce bloodshed and deaths .

We should offer earthquake workers our full understanding .

Facing the caprice of nature , humankind is really insignificant .

Furthermore , although our sense of security increases with each passing day in line with " significant advances achieved " in seismology , we cannot look to anyone to give us any promises .

Because , once someone has made a promise , he would be doomed thereafter to bear this bloody weight of " being unable to effectively avoid earthquake disasters ."

And by not issuing any promises , he could actually avoid being censured .

Humans can manufacture tanks that are much more powerful than ants , but humans cannot manufacture a living ant...

However advanced instruments manufactured by humans are , their level of complexity cannot compare with a section of a toad 's nerve .

The directions of research into earthquake prevention and disaster minimization are just confined to research into the phenomenon of earthquakes , but efforts to intervene in urban construction , to formulate and supervise building standards , and perfect and improve disaster rescue mechanisms and other aspects have been neglected.... .

We have also become blindly abreast of foreign countries even in earthquake research : we do n't believe in living beings raised as part of nature ; we just believe in the instruments we ourselves manufacture .

We do n't believe the warnings sent out by nature ; we just believe the warnings emitted by instruments in laboratories .

We do n't believe in what is seen and heard with their own eyes by millions of ordinary people ; we just believe in the authoritative conclusions of experts and scholars .

Real estate is only one part of the national economy but the real estate phenomenon exists in every sector of the national economy .

The swift large @-@ scale failure and bankruptcy of collective enterprises and state @-@ owned enterprises is proof of this .

Things have reached the step where the national television station has to set up a stage with the country 's military singers , high @-@ class singers , as well as top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line celebrities from all walks of life singing to folks like Wang Shi for donations .

We should n't be too bothered if folks like Wang Shi say something unpleasant .

A defeated general can n't claim to be brave .

In front of folks like Wang Shi , the State Council are all defeated generals .

Because the missing @-@ in @-@ action army who built New China have been beaten to a pulp by folks like Wang Shi ; even if China has no earthquakes , there will be floods , as well as SARS , snowstorms , big freezes etc.

Relying on singing for donations , entertaining for one 's supper , will not solve the problem .

And time and time again asking the national television station to get out there and carry the national flag , carrying on like this in the name of the country is outrageous , it 's the State Council 's problem .

All the people with one mind " as the national anthem is inspired by the foresight of " always being prepared ", designed for " advance , advance , advance , enter ! " instead of being designed for repeated begging , pleading for donations , and fund @-@ raising .

When we go back to the 10 th Century AD , we find that the 10 th Century AD gave birth to the first entrepreneurs .

Are you afraid of going to Hell when you die ?

Yes , you are afraid - how could you not go just because you are afraid ?

Donate your property to the Church , show your loyalty to God and you won't go to Hell ,

so a lot of rich people donated their money to the Church before they died .

but their clergymen could n't manage it , and were unable to pass it on to the next generation . What could they do ?

They hired professional managers to run these Church enterprises ,

in no way because this was a great system , but rather that this was inevitable within the Church enterprises .

The appearance of a precursory sign does n't mean it can accurately forecast the three elements of an earthquake , because precursory signs are extremely complicated .

There are certain differences in the categories , breadths , distribution ranges , and duration of precursory signs of different types of earthquakes in different places .

The former occurs in areas where internal fault blocks or fault lines converge but not intersect , while the latter occurs in active fault lines .

Strike @-@ type earthquakes have various types of precursory signs , which are widespread , long @-@ lasting , and quite variable .

Slip @-@ type earthquakes have fewer types of precursory signs , which have a smaller distribution range , shorter duration period , and smaller range of change .

There should not be any safety problems for Class A buildings like those at the airport , hospitals and schools that are designed to withstand a intensity of 8 .

So most buildings in Chengdu should still be able to use after emergency assessment , and citizens may go home reassured .

If large sums of money have been spent to provide protection , yet it fails to work when the earthquake comes ,

such that nobody dares to live at home , is able to use hospitals , or accesses airports , then has the money been thrown for nothing ?

However , at the same time the government enacted the earthquake resistance criteria , it required all existing buildings which did not satisfy the criteria to be reinforced and removed of dangers in a timely fashion .

Thus one cannot shirk responsibilities on excuse that it is an old building .

In addition , the government also has criteria for earthquake resistance and prevention for rural buildings .

Kindergarten buildings also collapsed , and little children 's frail bodies fell helplessly next to the crumbled walls where they closed their innocent eyes forever .

We could n't help crying at this sorrowful scene .

Children are the flowers of our motherland and future of our motherland .

Natural disasters cannot be predicted , but the school buildings should not have collapsed .

Why are the buildings behind the school buildings still there while the school buildings where children studied collapsed from the first floor to the fourth floor leaving only crumbled walls ?

Children , you should n't have departed like this .

Deputies to the People 's Congress , please make an all @-@ around inspection of school buildings in all areas and inspect whether or not the school buildings in your constituencies are up to local earthquake @-@ resistance standards , and then quickly make a proposal according to the existing problems and push each level of the government to complete rectifications and improvements within a limited time .

There needs to be special legal procedures for the design , materials , construction , completion , and inspection of the school buildings to ensure that top priority be given to quality and durability .

Allowing all children to study safely is the sacred and bounden duty of the People 's Congress .

In June 1976 , 83 year @-@ old Mao Zedong had already been revived once after suffering a myocardial infarction .

To get effective care for his condition , the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CCP established a special treatment team , in charge of his medical treatment and care .

The Political Bureau also specifically assigned people to the task of Mao Zedong 's medical care , taking turns with the doctors and nurses to be on constant vigil at his living quarters .

On the day of the Tangshan Earthquake , i.e. July 28 th , those on duty at Mao Zedong 's quarters were Wang Dongxing , Wang Hongwen , and Mao Zedong 's confidential secretary , Zhang Yufeng .

In Mao Zedong 's residence , the glass window in the foyer door rattled uncontrollably , and there was a huge bang from below like a tractor starting up , with Mao Zedong 's sickbed shaking non @-@ stop.......

While Mao Zedong was convalescing , the employees and medical staff around him were all in a state of high tension , maintaining extremely silent surroundings and atmosphere .

After the nineties , state @-@ owned engineering enterprises stopped recruiting construction workers .

But that is n't to say they stopped hiring people , but those they took in were all graduates with professional diplomas from polytechnic schools , technical colleges , and universities ; these staff all went into management .

During the early nineties , the formal employees of this enterprise still had complete working teams , such as bricklaying teams , woodwork teams , steel reinforcement teams , and machinery maintenance teams , but since they could not cope with a large volume of project tasks , they were already cooperating with some migrant worker units , in other words the familiar " contracting gangs ".

Due to formal working units no longer taking on young employees , working units got increasingly older and broken up .

And at this time , migrant worker units gained an opportunity to develop .

In each case of corruption , those power @-@ wielding bureaucrats , those scholars or technicians who have cornered the market in their fields , those capitalists with vast wealth , they are the ruling force of this society , and also the ones who profit from the corruption .

In privatized societies , everybody tramples over others trying to maximize their own interests .

Doctors who do n't receive ' red envelopes ' have no motivation to properly cure the patient .

Teachers openly ask students to give them gifts ,

gang ringleaders use cash to have the media make them out as heroes ,

capitalists trying to annex state @-@ owned property team up with scholars and academically demonstrate state @-@ owned monopolies to be the reason behind corruption , and then reap in the profits .

Do commodity prices have a base value worth talking about ?

With things , less is more ; sell as much as you want , as long as somebody will buy .

In the area of profiting from commodities , there have been no systems in place and no legal provisions ever since the reforms , there is no last word on how many multiples of cost profits are allowed to be , or what percentage .

China 's self @-@ sufficient , natural economy was not without any advantages . At least it did n't try to reap large profits off its own people ,

A home appliance - whether you are Chinese or a foreigner , which regional category you fit in , whether you are a big city or a small city , whether you are a worker or a peasant - is always the same price .

Not knowing how much profit is in there , not caring who can afford it and who can n't , these do not seem to be the principles of socialism .

And with farmers ' grain and rural products , if the country does n't wipe out agricultural taxes and does n't offer any subsidies , keeping on producing is a problem .

In order to improve the people 's living standards , the government set things so that grain is always the same price whether sold to big cities or to rich people .

This issue should attract the close attention of economists .

December 26 , 1975 , Mao Zedong had his 82 th birth day , his last one .

Upon turning 80 , Mao Zedong felt apparently that he was old and would die soon .

Therefore , around his birthday those few years , Mao Zedong had always talked about life and death from time to time .

One thing he often said was : " 73 and 84 are ages at which you will be gone even if the King of Hell does n't call you ."

Also since he turned 80 , people had been paying more and more attention to Mao Zedong 's birthday .

Within the country , people dared not celebrate his birthday publicly , so they would celebrate quietly at home .

Local governments dared not present gifts to Mao Zedong , but would convey their blessings to Mao Zedong in various ways .

In the years before Mao Zedong passed away , his hometown Hunan would specially send things like long life noodles on December 26 every year .

Despite Microsoft 's status as the globe 's most financially endowed high @-@ tech leader , bargaining with Microsoft is something that is sure to leave you greatly disillusioned .

So when the Jerry Yangs hope that by bargaining they can bump up Microsoft 's purchase price , they are being very unrealistic .

Microsoft raising its price ever so slightly already represented a big concession , proving that it really does want to get its hands on Yahoo ! .

Ultimately choosing to give it up was obviously a very painful decision for Microsoft .

To us global observers watching the bustling scene , giving up the acquisition was like a play stopped abruptly halfway through , without ever getting the chance to watch the rest of the fun , and indeed there was no shortage of theatrical transformations .

We have no choice but to return back to our mundane lives , and wait for this increasingly passion @-@ destroying industry to come up with the next affair of note .

Since last September , when his daughter was diagnosed with symptoms such as bloody feces and kidney stones , Zhou Jin has been in succession to Yongzhou in Hunan , Hebei , Xiamen , Beijing , Guangzhou , and more to take his daughter to hospitals for treatment , but the child 's illness has continued to improve and decline .

This September , Zhou Jin , working in Shenzhen , took his daughter to the Shenzhen Children 's Hospital for examination and treatment .

Zhou Jin said that his daughter , a little over two years old this year , had eaten Sanlu milk powder for over a year . Last September after the bloody feces appeared , family members took his daughter to the Yongzhou hospital for examination . The doctors informed them that " there is no better treatment method , just have her drink more water ."

Worrying about his daughter 's illness , Zhou Jin asked the county hospital to issue a certificate to transfer her to another hospital , to let his daughter go to a better hospital for treatment .

The hospital Medical Administration Department told Zhou Jin that issuing of the certificate to transfer to another hospital would require the approval of the Ministry of Health , and more than one month would be needed .

" I went repeatedly to find the relevant health department , but they passed my case back and forth . I was helpless and could only take my daughter to the place where I work -- Xiamen , to carry out treatment ."

The doctor in charge told us that the kid would be out of danger if he could just urinate .

The hospital already arranged for him to undergo dialysis surgery .

Out of danger at last , but one trouble passed and another one took its place , there came an acute diarrhea and fever , he was stooling several dozen times every day , you can imagine the suffering .

He had just danced a circle around the Grim Reaper , and encounted this problem on top of that . I was really worried he would n't pull through .

I do n't know what was happening with the injection treatment at the hospital - the more they injected him the worse the diarrhea , nothing would stop it .

After a few more days of treatment , the kid 's diarrhea was a little better and the doctors got him to do an ultrasound .

The hospitalization was very expensive and our family could n't afford it , so we had no choice but to leave the hospital and go home .

The whole family was really excited , we all thought he was better , that he was cured .

On the same day , in Shuimogou District , No.106 Bus had just pulled up at the Gaojiazhuang stop when several people were injected , soon , the Uyghur assailants jumped from the bus and fled , but they were soon detained after bystanders gave chase .

On August 31 , the No. 17 bus exploded near Xibei Road , while the No. 14 bus was bombed at the same time .

The incompetence of the Xinjiang government would make the Central extremely troublesome !

Listening to Yesterday Once More by the Carpenters , seeing the photograph album in which photos showing collages of compatriots receiving awards , I do n't know when people should cry , and my heart is lost .

Dear friends , let me fill in some of the words for the melody right now in my heart .

Do n't worry , the cold @-@ blood is n't me , it 's a part of my heart .

If an Olympic Games were held taking the damage done to mankind by industrial pollution as theme , I think our dear motherland should be able to win a gold medal and a champion of winning the grand total in gold medals . I just do n't know how the opening ceremony would be run , how volunteers should be recruited , or which song should be sung lustily .

The title of the sick man of East Asia once went far away following the revolutionary course brimming with victories , but after seeing this group of photos , I feel that they have whistled back with this brand new attitude of faster , higher , stronger .

Because we and our motherland cannot depart from this shocking pollution . What we can do is just to improve , adjust and vaguely hope .

The people who have been sacrificed have , without choice , used their lives to pave the road to success for another group of people .

At that time , tens of thousands of city youth headed to the countryside , but by no means were all of them were true believers .

Some were under pressure to show their " revolutionary zeal ", others went because there were no jobs in the city .

The poverty and backwardness of the countryside were appalling , and most of the educated youth became disillusioned .

In the middle of the 1970 's the intensity of the Cultural Revolution waned , and one after one the youths returned to the cities or went to study in university , but back then there was n't an exam to get into university , it depended on your political background and behavior .

Jianguo was not one of these . He worked for seven years in a rural part of Inner Mongolia , became a village head , and was very popular with the locals .

He was a dab hand at working the fields , and could match the locals when it came to drinking spirits .

He married an old school friend of his from Beijing , and she stayed behind for him , the two living their own little lives together in the country .

Although the villagers had no interest in the various kinds of " revolutionary practices " that Jianguo tried to make them adopt , he was honest and kind , and his generous personality won their friendship and affection .

Jianguo went to the square to listen to speeches and singing , and watched a new generation of students be rebellious , and was shaken and moved .

At that time I lived in Beijing , and every day went to the square . When we ran into each other , Jianguo did n't say much . However it looked like he had a million thoughts stirring in his heart .

One afternoon , I went to see an active figure in the square , and arranged to go together with him .

Friends greeted me with smiles , and asked me to go into their tent , as a meeting of student leaders was going on inside .

Jianguo was just behind me and had just started to come inside , when my friends frowned and stopped him : " No , you can n't come inside ! "

I explained , saying this was my brother . My friends listened with surprise .

Beijing @-@ born and Beijing @-@ raised Jianguo , he looked today completely like a villager from the countryside .

He pointed out , all of his reports were made under the circumstances that the normal reports did n't work , and he had no choice but made reports online .

A typical example is that the fall of Dong Feng , the most debaucherous secretary labeled as one @-@ husband @-@ with @-@ two @-@ wife in the country .

Wang Peirong thinks that Dong Feng 's absurdity and corruption was actually an open secret , but nobody investigated and penalized ; and even though Wang Peirong reported on this using his real name to the concerned departments for one year , no one bothered to inquire about it .

Wang Peirong also thinks that reporting online is equivalent to publicizing the corruptive deeds of the person being reported against . Once under the public eye , the possibility of any blatant cover @-@ ups becomes greatly reduced , thus , making it easier to investigate and penalize .

There are likely three original reasons why 360 uses a person 's name to issue Chargeback Rival :

General manager Zhou has done too much bad stuff on PC 's , and did n't want to offend too many people on cell phones , so he found an individual author to act as a scapegoat ( if a cell phone SP company knew that it was 360 that block their way . Each one of them is tough.);

Using an individual author to issue it , it was easy to defraud the grassroots netizens of their sense of identification and sympathy .

If you see I am an individual netizen , who has been charged money , so makes a piece of software in order to help everyone solve this problem , then how moved it seems from the outside .

Using an individual author to issue , there has been a strong power of captivation . Many companies in the SP and wireless realm would definitely think that a product from an individual author would not have much influence , so would not pay too much attention to it .

Nevertheless , 360 already did this under cover of promoting Chargeback Rival in large scale . Once after Chargeback Rival became dominant on the situation , then it is to be transformed into 360 .

Having seen no hope from Xu Ming , Wang Peirong then could only post the relevant problems online .

Not only that , Wang Peirong 's generous and courageous endeavors have led to revenge from the reported on numerous occasions : when reporting the corruption of Li Rongqi , he was severely beaten up by hired goons ; when reporting the black forces , he was retaliated by the black forces , and hospitalized for the injuries .

But these have not been able to halt the momentum of Wang Peirong 's reporting .

However , in the program , Wang Peirong calls out to the parties and the government to set out policies and provisions to protect the personal safety and legal rights of whistle blowers .

But in contrast with this , Wang Peirong , well reputed as Jiangsu 's " number one person in online anti @-@ corruption ", is now suffering unfair treatment .

Because of pressure from the reported officials such as Li Rongqi , China 's University of Mining and Technology has suspended Wang Peirong 's teaching duties .

How China University of Mining and Technology responds to Jiangsu mainstream media 's positive and active appraisal of Wang Peirong ; how well they treat Wang Peirong ; and how they protect Wang Peirong 's legal rights , are unavoidable questions placed in front of the Mining University 's decision makers .

The Chinese defense budget for 2012 is RMB 670.274 billion , increasing by RMB 67.604 billion and 11.2 % compared to the previous year 's estimated budgetary expenditure .

The Chinese military expenditures are increasing too fast for America , and the increase is currently over RMB 100 billion , but what on earth can China do with this additional amount of more than RMB 100 billion dollars ?

If it is used to manufacture Chinese J @-@ 10 fighters , over two hundred planes can be produced , or perhaps even more . In one go , China can improve its prowess in the air by a margin even greater than the total sum of a mid @-@ sized Western country .

In fact , what America really fears is not the increase of military expenditure , but rather the rapid rate at which China is upgrading its military technologies , which may enable China to overtake America soon .

Compared to America , China has many inadequacies , for instance , its high technology development is not as mature as America 's , and its basic infrastructure , the standard of education of its citizens , development of its systems and so on are also lacking . However , China has its own natural advantages , and that is China possesses a long history and stability of culture .

Some people pointed out in their comments that this is a serious disadvantage to China when compared to America , as they say that China is carrying too heavy a burden which will hinder rapid development ,

in fact , this reasoning is extremely incorrect , the Chinese culture is profound , so whatever problems the country may face , it can draw on its historic experiences ,

for instance , when China deals with international affairs , it can learn from how the Yuan Dynasty handled foreign trade and the problems of co @-@ existence between multiple ethnic groups , or it could at least draw a lesson from the negative experiences .

Currently America is drastically cutting down on its military expenditure , however it fears that China will substantially increase its military expenditure . America is desperately attempting to return to the Pacific Ocean as it wishes to continue to contain the growth of Chinese military strength ,

America controls the Straits of Malacca , and a large majority of China 's shipping vessels are under its control . However if America wishes to maintain the development of world trade order , its expenses will naturally be enormous .

If it were not for the financial crisis , a number of Western countries have stated that they would not have considered budgetary issues for American military deployments .

As a matter of fact , neighboring countries need not be too sensitive to the sharp increase in Chinese military spending . They fear that China will pose a direct threat to them , but Chinese history has shown that China has never had the habit of wielding its military might to challenge Western countries , but as for how they habitually view China will depend on the profound influence of the Chinese culture .

China does not like to show off , preferring to restrain itself , and the same is true in the field of military matters .

Up to now , China revealed that it has three models of the 4 th generation stealth fighter planes under research and development , and the J20 is expected to enter mass production and service next year , which is a direct blow to America ,

however , what is even more terrifying for America is that this Chinese fighter plane model has already displayed surprisingly advanced performance during combat , and it is feared that its level of technological advancement cannot be matched by the F22. After all , this model of fighter plane has never participated in actual inspections up to this point .

Perhaps this is understandable for China , but it is inevitable that the 4 th generation Chinese fighter plane would create a stir .

Of course there is a strong possibility that this number has been greatly exaggerated , and it is also embellished by the China Threat theory . However , such moves by America no longer has much effect on China , even if the Chinese defense expenditures reach US $ 200 billion , America cannot do anything to China ,

Recently , China adopted an aggressive stance , casting negative votes on the Syria issue three times , and in relation to Japan 's naming of the Diaoyu Islands , Beijing appears to be sending a message that ' we have accumulated sufficient power , and we are not afraid of your distortions of the truth .'

The Chinese military expenditures are soaring . By contrast , America is continuously cutting down on its military expenditures , repeatedly asserting that its prowess will be replaced by small but elite troops that will not affect its capabilities . As it is nothing more than self @-@ consolation , therefore , it caused widespread concern throughout America .

Certainly , this is clearly a refurbished version of the ' military threat theory ' from America , and it is now changed to a ' threat by military expenditure theory ', however , China is used to finger @-@ wagging and criticism from America , and as China grows increasingly confident , this writer believes that America will terminate its friendly economic relations with China soon or later ,

China 's soaring military expenditures imply that China is reluctant to be limited to a position as the world 's No. 2 , and nor is it content to be world No. 1 in name only . Instead , it intends to recover its historical 1,500 @-@ year glory as the leader of the world .

Faced with rascals and hooligans like the Americans , the Chinese have no choice but to arm themselves .

Indeed . I wonder what our military expenditure is like in proportion to America 's , and besides how much of our military expenditure is genuinely spent on sophisticated national defenses , if it is really spent on advanced defenses , there will never be such a thing as too much ! Compared to America we are still lagging far behind !

Now that Vice President Xi has visited America , the direction for the Sino @-@ American relationship has become the focus of world attention .

But no matter how sweetly imperialist America talks , I have no hope for imperialist America .

Imperialist America has always been a country failing to live up to its words , and as long as something is in its interests , it will spare no effort and use any means to get it .

The relationship between China and imperialist America is like that between the sheep and the wolf , and do n't expect the wolf to change its ambition ,

Ultimately , it will reveal its wolf nature , and I hope the sheep will not be fooled by it .

The whole world expects China and America to coexist peacefully , jointly preside over and deal with international affairs , and build a peaceful new international order .

The peaceful coexistence of China and America is also the common wish of the people in the two countries .

Nevertheless , the peace we aspire to will be only our good wish .

Maintaining friendly relations with imperialist America is only the wishful thinking of some Chinese !

Though there is a great distance between China and America and there are no territorial disputes , unlike our relationship with the Polar Bear , there is a direct conflict of interest .

However , due to ideological difference between China and America and the lack of the necessary trust and communication in handling international affairs , it is particularly imperialist America , in its effort to contain the development of China and its threat to its hegemonic position , that makes trouble wherever possible to constrain the takeoff of the Chinese dragon .

Actually , imperialist America has the initiative in terms of whether the two major countries , China and America can get along ,

China has done a lot , and sacrificed a lot , for the Sino @-@ American relationship ,

out of its wishful thinking , China uses its warm face to caress the cold ass of imperialist America , but it is still unable to win imperialistic America 's sincerity , causing the Sino @-@ American relationship to waver and even fall backwards .

In future times , as China challenges its world hegemony and imperialist America attempts to retain it , more clashes will happen , conflicts will be inevitable , and the struggle will become ever more ferocious .

In recent years , as China 's reform and opening @-@ up campaign has reached greater depths , the people 's living standards have improved substantially , and its defense and military strength has also developed rapidly .

The status of China as a major world power has begun to be more prominent , and in dealing with and directing international affairs , China has played an ever more important role .

China 's rapid growth and rise has gradually threatened and challenged the hegemonic position of imperialist America .

This makes imperialist America restless , and it has devised every possible means to contain and check China 's development .

Imperialist America wants to upset and restrain China with its military sales to Taiwan and the Taiwan issue !

Imperialist America wants to control the Middle East and suppress Syria and Iran mainly because it covets the important strategic location and abundant resources of the Middle East .

Imperialist America wants to overthrow the Bashar regime to get rid of the Polar Bear 's only military base in the Middle East ! It does not want the influence of the Polar Bear to exist in the Middle East region over the long term .

Imperialist America wants to topple Iran mainly to take on China , to control China 's resources and contain China 's development .

In addition , it also wants to suppress the Polar Bear and squeeze the living space of China and Russia .

In today 's world , the only countries that can constitute a threat to the hegemonic position of imperialist America are China and , to a lesser degree , the Polar Bear .

Imperialist America has had far @-@ reaching strategic foresight , and each step it takes serves to consolidate its hegemony .

Imperialist America is suppressing China in an all @-@ round way , and we can see imperialist America 's meddling presence in the economy , politics and military affairs .

Imperialist America has been supporting little Japan , India , the Philippine servants and the Vietnamese monkeys , disturbing the stable environment around China to disrupt the peaceful development and rise of China .

Imperialist America is now pompously returning to the Asia Pacific region and reshuffling its military deployment , directly targeting China .

Taiwan is the deepest pain for all Chinese , because imperialist America has long taken Taiwan as a pawn and used it as a bargaining chip in the struggle with China .

It 's a pity that many Chinese are still hoping to make friends with imperialist America and maintain a friendship with imperialist America from generation to generation .

Furthermore , the many strategic adjustments and ideas of imperialist America are all aimed at the rising China .

Compatriots ! Wake up ! Imperialist America has already aimed its guns to our heads , do not keep daydreaming !

Imperialist America takes China as its prime rival and enemy , give up your fantasy that you can make friends with the enemy !

The best method is to make good use of our time to step up our own defense and military construction , cast away all the illusions , and get ready for war !

Our ancestors wisely said , " Harbor no ill intention against others , but never relax one 's vigilance "!

This is the necessary psychology for getting along with friends , but at this moment imperialist America is our enemy staring like a tiger watching its prey , making it more necessary for us to remain vigilant at this time !

China has made a lot of sacrifices to improve its relations with imperialist America , and China has all along tried to become friends with imperialist America ,

although China now needs a peaceful and stable environment for its development , we can n't make continual investments without any return .

Can Sino @-@ American relations be improved ? Is friendly development possible ? The key question lies with imperialist America , not China .

Imperialist America has always held the initiative in the development of Sino @-@ American relations .

In fact , it is not difficult for China and America to become friends , because China and America , despite their ideological differences , have no land or territorial disputes .

Though China and America have fought each other on the battlefield , the wars were not directly between China and America .

If imperialist America sincerely wants to make friends with China , it must display its sincerity and let the Chinese people see actual actions and results .

If imperialist America can stop its military sales to Taiwan , provide no support to Taiwan , and ensure peace across the Taiwan Straits , it will allow China to accomplish its great cause of national reunification .

If it refrains from meddling in China 's internal human rights issues , and also does not intervene in other affairs such as Tibet , I believe that China will also sacrifice its other interests to reciprocate the good faith of imperialist America !

Only if imperialist America does this can China and America truly become friends and co @-@ exist peacefully as friends from generation to generation .

Being used to being a hegemon , imperialist America likes to intervene in the internal affairs and human rights affairs of other countries , and Taiwan is the best chess piece for containing China , so I believe imperialist America will not easily let go of it !

There is even less possibility that it will tolerate a Chinese challenge to its position as the world hegemon !

In the years to come , instead of becoming friends , China and America will only become rivals and even enemies !

Therefore , it 's unnecessary to harbor any fantasies about imperialist America , China should fundamentally change its mentality , there is no need to fear imperialist America , and we should be ready for a military confrontations with imperialist America at any time .

Let 's win the respect of imperialist America and the whole world with our strength .

Only baptized by war can China really become a world power .

The Chinese should be ever vigilant and not be deceived by the present peace , active war preparation is the only right choice ,

only when our defense and military have become strong , will we be able to eradicate all aggressors , and only through the baptism of war can China become a truly powerful country .

What China needs to do is to cast away its illusions and get ready for war .

China Mobile is no doubt a monopolized operator in China , the biggest mobile phone market in the world . It has also expressed clearly its ambition to step outside the country and participate in global competitions .

Even though the performances of Chinese companies are not outstanding in the course of globalization , Wang Jianzhou , President and CEO of China Mobile , is determined to change all this .

He stated that the objective of China Mobile is to become a world @-@ class company .

Apart from the seven partners , who are called the ' Seven Swords ' inside IDG , the participants also included over 190 CEOs of companies that IDG invested in and representatives from investment banks and consulting agencies .

According to the practice of the past six years , after each IDG conference , there will always be some participants who make the list of magnates of the year .

I insisted on not paying him . Finally , he cracked and fled in panic .

However , I was also at the verge of collapse because the people 's police at 110 whom I looked forward to still had not arrived yet .

Children of the rich and government officials , who does n't want to enhance their status through overseas study ?

However , those in middle class families or even laid @-@ off workers see those children of the wealthy and powerful go overseas , come back cloaked in glory and all have a good future ( they do n't know that family wealth and good backgrounds of those are the only real guarantees ) . How wonderful ! Thereupon , they pinch and scrape to send their child overseas ,

Nowadays , it is more often the case that those who do n't pass the university entrance exam and are wasting their days at home without doing anything are sent overseas . With a bit of " toughening up ", everything will be okay .

Wrong ! With a huge chunk of cash spent , the frightening thing is that the payoff falls far short of expectations .

What I have experienced myself or , even more , what I have seen are the countless who have given up their studies year by year , those with wrecked health everywhere , those who sold their souls and even those who lost their lives .

Overseas study is a splendid term , but in return it demands youth , effort and staunch perseverance , as well as sufficient rationality .

Life is never a bed of roses in any location , even more in a foreign land where there is a language barrier , different customs and no family or friends .

The proposal on " the transfer of reproduction rights " is originate from the same track the proposal on " controlling the number of rural children going to college "! What else are these representatives if not do @-@ nothing politicians ?

Complete and obvious bullshit ! More sinister than directly selling and buying infants !

The one @-@ child policy is the most insidious policy , thoroughly antihuman and racially discriminatory , an open trampling on the right of survival right for Han people as a whole . Those who formulated and implemented this policy are all fascists ; they should be brought to trial at the International Court , and the people principally responsible for it should be hanged .

As known to all , Shanghai and Hong Kong have very low birth rates and mainly depend on migrants to maintain their population sizes and keep their populations young ; there is good economic development ;

In recent years , due to labor shortages , millions of black people and Southeast Asians have come to the southeast , and have caused varied degrees of deterioration in social order .

Just like Shanghai and Hong Kong , China depends on immigrants and at the same time pursues the one @-@ child policy , making the planning policy look like a very clever policy !

Shanghai and Hong Kong maintain their social development by absorbing migrants from other provinces , what will happen if China prepares herbal medicine by the prescribed method and absorbs foreigners ?

Do n't wait till the situation has become unmanageable and then drive away the gypsies as Sarkozy did ; German Chancellor Angela Merkel has just recently declared that Germany has failed to build a diversified society and will limit the development of the immigrant population ; now that the sheep have been stolen , no choice but to mend the fold !

Before long , the dividends for the population would wear out . As immigrant laborers swarmed in ( these people are not subject to family planning ) , the population would soon experience racial replacement , and China , as Yugoslavia did , would soon disintegrate !

The blacks , Arabs , and Vietnamese , one after another , would demand their rights , autonomy , and independence !

One after another , the local areas would become independent , as Kosovo did !

The minority peoples in Xinjiang and Tibet can bear more children , causing the proportion of the Han people compared to the population of the frontier ethnic regions to decline quickly ;

The regiments of troops and Sichuan women that such national heroes as Zuo Zongtang and Wang Zhen took great pains to transplant into Xinjiang and Tibet are being quickly exterminated by the one @-@ child policy ; the undercurrents of Xinjiang Independence and Tibetan Independence are getting ever more rampant !

The family planning policy and the one @-@ child policy have put the country in an dangerous as stacking eggs , and posed a threat to the survival of the nation .

Family planning has effectively reduced the Chinese population by 300 million , postponing the Day of 7 Billion by 3 years ; According to the plan of the Planning Commission , even if the Chinese population is reduced by 1 billion , the Day of 7 Billion will be postponed for just another few years !

But the Chinese nation will be on the brink of extinction . Such selfless notions which nobody will have until evolving into a nonhuman creature , surprisingly , has become a reality in China !

Family planning is part of the plan to massively exterminate the Han people , and the beginning of dividing China !

The family planning policy is extremely stupid and the ultimate in self @-@ castration . It is unprecedented from a historic perspective and will be unmatchable in the future ; and in the global perspective , it is totally unique !

The self @-@ harming policy fully embodies the malice of the enemy and the stupidity of the those in power , brings disasters to both the country and the people , is totally void of conscience , contributes nothing to the contemporary time , leaves a legacy of trouble for a long time in future , and will definitely become a joke that those throughout all history will ridicule !

The other day , Xinwen Lianbo reported that the difficulty for enterprises to hire workers has extended to the west and swept the whole country !

The family planning policy is extremely stupid , brings disasters to both the country and the people , and is totally void of conscience !

Through free exchanges on the market , nearly everything can be bought and sold .

They have money to buy the right , to bear the child , and to raise the child .

As to these transfers and transactions of the right to bear a second child , let 's have a look at how the representatives argued and legally struggled with government officials at the " Two Meetings ".

To this question , Li Xinghao @-@ the author of this proposal , NPC representative and Chairman of Zhigao Group , said that such a transfer is beneficial to improving the quality of the population .

Li Xinghao asserts that " In today 's society , people with strong educational backgrounds , the rich class , and civil servants have relatively high social status , relatively good economics means , and can ensure basic educational conditions and a good environment for the newborn population to develop in ".

Li Xinghao gave his own specific explanation from the angle of market supply and demand .

He said , " For a transfer , people are not classified into the rich and the poor , but into those who have a demand and those who do not .

He said that the original motive for this proposal was rooted in his discovery that some families legally allowed to bear a second child , due to their poverty and other reasons , would become even more impoverished if they were to do so ;

while some rich families had a strong desire to bear a second child but did not have the allowance to do so .

He thinks that this conflict really exists , and the relevant governmental departments can take the initiative to establish a transfer platform ."

On the one hand , it helps the government to reduce and narrow the gap of wealth ;

on the other hand , it also solves the structural conflict of the reproduction right market @-@ the poor have allowances but cannot afford the birth and upbringing , while the rich want to bear children but do n't have the allowance .

Based on Representative Li 's proposal , the rich will voluntarily reduce their per capita wealth by bearing and raising more children , while the poor will increase their per capita wealth by bearing and raising fewer children .

Through such transfers and transactions of the right to bear a second child between the rich and the poor , the government can unnoticeably narrow the ever @-@ increasing gap between the poor and the rich without spending a single cent .

This Representative Li has envisioned a fast track for the get @-@ rich @-@ first people to guide and assist the get @-@ rich @-@ later people . That is , " the allowance transferee shall give the transferor ' an entire sequence ' of help and support ."

" According to Li Xinghao 's plan , through lottery @-@ type drawing , the transfer platform establishes a one @-@ on @-@ one guidance and assistance relationship between the transferee and the transferor .

As part of the assistance , the couple applying for the allowance to be transferred in to them will buy the transferring couple all the basic insurances currently required by the government , including social insurance , medical insurance , and personal accident insurance , and will continue to provide them with a minimum living guarantee for the rest of their lives .

Meanwhile , the applicant couple will also provide financial support for the education of the transferring couple 's child until he or she graduates from university .

What 's more , if the transferring couple intend to register as permanent urban residents , the applicant couple shall buy them a 35m2 socially subsidized apartment in the city where the applicants dwell , but all of the transferring couple 's land use rights in the countryside will belong to the applicant couple ."

What do our family planning officials think of this proposal that the State " utilize the transferring of rights to bear a second @-@ child to improve the population quality and make the get @-@ rich @-@ first help the get @-@ rich @-@ later so as to realize common prosperity "?

In response , " Yesterday , Zhang Feng , Director of Guangdong Provincial Family Planning Commission , made his stance clear to the media that the right to reproduce is absolutely not transferrable .

In the event that the right to reproduce is transferred , it would not only be a violation of law , but also bring moral questions if it involved a transaction ."

Through transferring their right to bear a second child and the concomitant obligations imposed on the transferees , the poor can get rich with the guidance and assistance from the get @-@ rich @-@ first class , if the proposal can pass and become law , the poor undoubtedly have found in the rich class , well @-@ educated class , and the bureaucratic class an obedient son to provide for them up until they die . Marvelous indeed .

Does not the bundle of obligations proposed by this Representative Li still imply a contract on the exchange and transaction of land use rights ?

Certainly , without such exchange of interests , why would the rich take an interest in providing for the children of the poor ?

If the legislature really wants to adopt this proposal on the premise of the get @-@ rich @-@ first class leading the get @-@ rich @-@ later class to become rich by giving them one @-@ on @-@ one guidance and assistance so as to improve our population quality and narrow our wealth gap , it must ensure fairness in such exchange of interests and during the transfer .

For a transfer of the right to marry , people are not classified into the rich and the poor , but into those who have a demand and those who do not . Since I discovered that some men who have a legal right to marry , due to their poverty and other reasons , would become even more impoverished if they did marry ;

while some rich men have a strong desire to marry N concubines ( because their mistresses often fuss about wanting to get married ) but they do not have the allowance , and would be guilty of bigamy .

I think that this conflict really exists , and the relevant governmental departments can take the initiative to establish a platform to transfer the right to marry .

If it was bought with public funds , it may be said that what they are smoking are not cigarettes but the " blood and sweat " of the taxpayers .

NPC Representative Ma Wenfang proposed that consumption of tobacco products on public expenses should be universally banned .

There are of course many reasons as to why we lag far behind in meeting our tobacco control objectives .

Among this legion of smokers , a considerable number smoke " free cigarettes " which they do n't have to buy with their own money , as they were received as gifts or bought with public funds .

It is precisely because they are not using their own money that they usually smoke luxury cigarettes which are unaffordable for most people .

Their track performance for blowing smoke rings also has a compounding effect in repeatedly setting new records for consumption expenses by civil servants , and it has become an organic portion of officialdom corruption as a whole .

It was precisely this horrifying social backdrop that prompted NPC Representative Ma Wenfang to solemnly set forth her proposal that consumption of tobacco products on public funds be universally banned .

In our country , there are many civil servants who think their family name is " Gong " and such that every expense incurred by them , regardless of whether it is for public or private purpose , should be borne by the public . Therefore , consumption on public expenses can involve almost everything imaginable .

For instance , besides luxury cigarettes , other examples include luxury liquor , fine wining and dining , luxury cars , and overseas tours , and whatever luxury enjoyment and extravagant entertainment they can imagine , they would want to have them all and enjoy them to fullest , using public funds to settle the bill in full .

If the supreme authorities had to draw up separate regulatory documents to address every single item for consumption on public expenses for nationwide circulation in order to check such extravagances , the mountain of documents will really extend towards the sky .

In fact , all that needs to be done is to clearly include tobacco products within the anti @-@ corruption regulations ' relevant clauses for prohibition of consumption on public funds , and it will suffice .

As for the remaining issues , we must ensure that the orders and prohibitions are fully enforced . If any civil servant dares to violate the law , he will be severely punished according to the law and regulations .

If this was really carried out in all localities at every level , there would be no cause to worry that the corrupt practice of consumption on public expenses , including smoking on public funds , cannot be curbed .

After deputies and committee members have moved into their quarters in the hotel , how would service staff greet them ?

Some greet them with " Deputy So @-@ and @-@ so " or " Committee Member So @-@ and @-@ so ; " while some call NPC deputies " chief , " which makes some deputies , especially deputies from the grass @-@ roots level , feel somewhat embarrassed . Some deputies even request service staff to " not call me chief ."

Calling deputies and committee members who have moved into their quarters in the hotel " chief " is , of course , out of the hotel service staff member 's formal respect , but it has actually caused misunderstanding of the identity of deputy or committee member .

However , at the two conferences , according to common sense , the identity of " deputy " or " committee member " is generally used , that is , " Deputy xx " or " Committee Member xx." But I cannot say much for the mention of " deputy as a chief ."

Through the subtlety of greeting , we can see common people 's sense of awe towards " deputies " and " committee members ."

Would n't it appear more cordial to directly greet them as " Deputy xx " or " Committee Member xx ? "

After greeting them as chiefs , do n't you have a sense of awe and awkwardness ?

As deputies , they should equally treasure their own first identity . Deputy or committee member is neither an administrative official post nor a honorary title . This identity means enormous responsibility .

At the " times of the two conferences , " deputies and committee members should have an even heightened sense of responsibility . No matter what kind of social status you yourself have , remember firmly your own first identity and most important identity is a deputy , a committee member .

Gosh , they even dare to use the word ' awe .' Common people could n't wait to ' despise ' them , how could they have a sense of ' awe ? '

What would you say , which thingy there is publicly elected by common people formed by the first , second , and third person such as you , me , and him ?

Before the two national conferences were convened , various major news websites and periodicals across the country in succession invited netizens and readers nationwide to submit " suggestions for the two conferences ."

This writer from " suggestions for the two conferences " submitted by netizens across the country on various major news websites on the central government 's strengthening of efforts to oppose corruption and promote honest government , better supervision of the government and officials , and severe punishment for people engaged in embezzlement and corruption .

When CPPCC delegate Mao Xinyu checked in to attend the " two conferences " and spoke of a motion he proposed this year , he said the emphasis was on anti @-@ corruption efforts .

The anti @-@ corruption drive involves everyone , from the ordinary people below up to and including the delegates to the two conferences .

At present , public expenditure on food and entertainment nationwide has already reached 300 billion a year .

Such a huge figure for public expenditure on food and entertainment crowds out expenditure on things vital for people 's welfare , including education , hygiene , healthcare , and social security .

are really unbelievable : annual public expenditure on food and entertainment actually reaches 300 billion ! How large is this figure of 300 billion ?

If we saved this 300 billion and invested it in the economically undeveloped and impoverished regions in China , how many schools could we build ?

How many poor families could we assist ? How many children forced to leave school could we assist ?

It 's a pity that this 300 billion is squandered with no results , wasted in the pursuit of debauchery , by corrupt officials - How could our people not hate the " parasites " hidden among the membership ranks of the Communist Party ?

When corruption among government officials is brought up , the ordinary people all gnash their teeth , but the ordinary people are , after all , the ordinary people , and can only look on helplessly in silent fury .

The ordinary people cannot afford to upset government officials , for if the ordinary people dared to upset government officials , they would be cracking eggs against rocks . Not only could they get more than they bargained for ; if something went wrong , they could end up in prison , or even endanger their lives .

Every year , there are cases across the country where ordinary people , because of reporting government officials , suffer the disaster of imprisonment if they get up lightly or the disaster of death if they are dealt with harshly .

It is common for ordinary people , with no other means of redress , to post on the Internet out of resentment against savage land requisitions or the savage demolition of homes and forced relocation by local government officials , but what fate do they often bring on themselves ?

Local government officials easily pin some labels on you , and you can even be chased and arrested by public security bodies across provincial boundaries .

The most terrible thing is not the government officials , but the power that lies in the hands of these officials .

If we are to prevent the " three types of consumption on public funds , " we must first " block " the officials ' mouths ,

but this is easier said than done . Why ?

As people working in a lower @-@ level work unit , if leaders from higher @-@ level work units come , do you dare not to entertain them in the most respectful way with nice things to eat and drink ?

If they are not entertained well with nice things to eat and drink , after they 've gone , will officials in the lower @-@ level work unit still have a future ?

To their subordinates , senior leaders are all their " masters." You can n't afford to upset any of them , and whoever upsets them is in for it . If you rub them up the wrong way when you 're trying to butter them up , you won't just jeopardize your official position , you won't even know what the consequences will be .

To stop the " three types of consumption on public funds , " senior officials must first " block " their own mouths .

In April 2011 , when the no. 6 inspection group of Hubei 's provincial party committee went to Yichang city on an inspection tour of Zigui county , a national @-@ level impoverished county , the local government officials were both delighted and worried .

What delighted them was that they had an opportunity to report their problems to senior leaders and have them taken seriously by them , and what worried them was that there were 13 people in the inspection group , coming for 20 days or so , and the entertainment expenses , the cost of the gifts , and the inspection fees and various other items of expenditure would altogether come to 801,900 yuan .

This example is the best illustration that if we are to prevent the " three types of consumption on public funds , " we must first stop the senior government officials .

If the central state authorities are to stop the " three types of consumption on public funds , " they must dare to do what they mean .

With the increasing prevalence of the alcohol culture at the grass @-@ roots institutions , alcohol has already been fermented and adulterated by the so @-@ called " bureaucratic culture " beyond recognition .

Some people put on high @-@ end wine banquets trying to please their superiors , some people use alcohol as gifts to seek personal gain , some people consider it a type of pleasure to get people to drink by using beer games , and some people get carried away because of their addiction to alcohol or drunkenness , adversely affecting their work .

This writer has lived for a long time at the grass @-@ roots level and often heard and witnessed some grass @-@ roots officials almost sitting at meal gatherings or attending banquets every day , and never getting tired of it .

Who should be blamed for the grass @-@ roots officials ' wining and dining becoming common practice ?

Throughout the year , various types of inspection groups and investigation groups , as numerous as the hairs on an ox , come and go in an endless stream , also making the grass @-@ roots institutions overburdened . Some grass @-@ roots leading cadres , with no choice but to run between the various dinner parties every day , also feel somewhat helpless .

There are also many people wallowing in the array of wine glasses and poker chips becoming " vessels for wine and bags for food ."

This writer met with some township officials . Facing more and more dinner parties , many of them are fed up with it , but also feel forced and helpless .

A township official , using his fingers to count , told this writer that in order to solve financial , road repair , canal construction projects and so on , they must entertain the relevant personnel and department heads , otherwise it will be of no avail .

Some people said that it borrowed the easterly wind of the Olympics . However , I think otherwise .

Even though the 2008 Olympics allowed Beijing to display its charisma in front of cameras of all caliber that frocked in from all sides ,

Those who were born and raised in Beijing in the 80 s can almost be called the generation who grew up sitting on the subway .

This underground railway line that runs through eastern and western Beijing has become Beijing 's symbol of alternative culture .

Day by day , Beijing is developing , so are its public transport and highways . Eventually , it will usher in the alarming data of 5 million cars in 2012 .

I have to applaud the continuous increase in the efforts in subway construction of Beijing in all these years when I talk about subway development .

In July 2001 , with the success in the bid to host the Olympics , Beijing subway Line 13 also ushered in the completion of the entire line and became the newest member of the Beijing subway family .

Meanwhile , in October 2007 , the closely watched subway Line 5 went into operation . It became the new trunk that links southern and northern Beijing and intersects with Line 1 .

While Beijing residents enjoyed the modernization of subway Line 5 , in July 2008 , the first phase of construction of subway Line 10 and in September 2009 , subway Line 4 and Line 8 all became operational one after another . At the same time , all suburban districts and counties are all connected by the subway successively .

In about 10 years time , the Beijing subway transformed from an underground supplementary means of transport that only had two lines to a 15 @-@ lined underground transportation network that covers almost the entire Beijing from Changping in the north to Daxing in the south , Mentougou in the west , and Tongzhou District in the east .

Such rapid development was almost unimaginable by anyone and unachievable by any country .

The rapid coverage of underground transportation has brought along prosperity to surrounding communities of the subway . Residents no longer have to worry about which bus route to take when they go out .

More residents gladly choose to travel by subway . It is both convenient and cozy .

Needless to say , the subway has brought about convenience to the travel and work of the residents . More commendable is that the convenient subway has allowed more residents to give up their cars and choose such green means of transportation that is environmental friendly .

Not only does a reduction in cars on the road alleviate traffic pressure on the road ; it also reduces the pressure of air pollution so that more residents can cheer for the blue sky of Beijing from their heart .

Beijing Forces Ma Ying @-@ jeou to Declare Stand on Unification , Taiwan Can No Longer Turn Back

In the midst of all this commotion , James Soong made a sudden appearance to come head to head with Ma Ying @-@ jeou in the elections .

This made the already worried Ma Ying @-@ jeou even more anxious , but there is nothing he can do .

This is linked to the earlier stand mainland China made regarding military cooperation with Taiwan . In addition , James Soong has expressed clearly that his taking part in the elections is to tell Ma Ying @-@ jeou that he had worked hard to get the 1992 Consensus from mainland China and Ma should not let everyone down .

Regarding the chaos in Taiwan and the future ultimate unification of mainland China and Taiwan , what else do we still need to face ? What else do we have to do ?

James Soong 's transfer of allegiance is to force the undecided Ma Ying @-@ jeou to declare his stand on the ultimate unification

Soong 's transfer of allegiance is , in a certain sense , a kind of response to mainland China 's intention .

from playing the Taiwan independence card for the sake of the elections to playing the card of attacking mainland China and achieving military balance for the sake of the elections . However , on the issue of the ultimate unification of mainland China and Taiwan , not only did Ma Ying @-@ jeou fail to make any progress , he even took a big step backward .

In the past , he was standing close to the middle . Now , he is starting to gradually follow the footsteps of the DPP . He keeps pushing the bottom line of mainland China for the mere sake of manipulating the elections . Furthermore , he completely ignores the compromises made by mainland China and the effort it has put in for peaceful unification .

To save the Taiwanese economy , mainland China has made huge policy adjustments such as absorbing Taiwan 's excess industrial capacity , buying Taiwan 's excess agricultural products , giving several Taiwanese political figures room for international affairs to carry out international affairs , etc.

However , after all this waiting , in the end it has to face Ma Ying @-@ jeou'a a double @-@ headed snake that is seemingly false and real at the same time .

Therefore , facing this undecided Ma Ying @-@ jeou , James Soong stepped up to defend mainland China !

Is n't Ma Ying @-@ jeou wanting to score more points for his selection ? Is n't he wanting to elevate his position through manipulating the people ?

The moment James Soong appeared , the situation changed ! This is to force Ma Ying @-@ jeou to stop manipulating the elections and declare his stand on the ultimate unification of mainland China and Taiwan !

Ma Ying @-@ jeou is Not Mainland China 's Only Choice , But Mainland China is Going to Be Ma Ying @-@ jeou 's Only Choice

as for military affairs - Taiwanese soldiers , whether ex @-@ service or in service , are all under the control of mainland China 's military departments .

Fellow countrymen should not slaughter one another , and brothers should not turn against one another - this makes the Taiwanese military less hostile towards mainland China .

To mainland China , Ma Ying @-@ jeou is no longer mainland China 's only choice .

Mainland China is actively seeking all forces in Taiwan that can be sought . Even the DPP is starting to change its course .

However , Ma Ying @-@ jeou , who is holding on and keeping his mouth tight , has no other choices except mainland China , in other words , mainland China is Ma Ying @-@ jeou 's only choice .

Basically , all the big bosses of the Kuomintang have visited mainland China and even received VIP treatment , getting all the respect they deserved .

So , is Ma Ying @-@ jeou thinking about his future position or the great cause of the national unification ?

Ma Ying @-@ jeou might offend some people in Taiwan who are eager to achieve Taiwan independence , but Ma Ying @-@ jeou can gain the respect of the entire Chinese population of 1.4 billion . Comparing the two , it should be clear which is important and which is not .

When Nixon visited China back then , he turned the Sino @-@ American relationship around . So , does n't Ma Ying @-@ jeou want his name to go down in history ?

Hence , Ma Ying @-@ jeou should understand that he is only one of the choices of mainland China . It is up to him whether he wants to achieve success and acquire fame .

Though the United States has recently increased its military presence in the Asia Pacific region , it is showing a rare undecided stand on the Taiwan issue .

The United States is no longer able to tell where Taiwan is heading , because all Taiwanese senior politicians are talking about unification and there is less and less talk about secession .

Furthermore , a certain tacit agreement between mainland China and Taiwan regarding the Diaoyu Islands has made the United States feel somewhat unable to do what it wants to do .

They no longer talk about military purchase but started proposing a lease @-@ to @-@ own method for Taiwan to get weapons .

The lease @-@ to @-@ own method might bring some advantages in conducting cutting @-@ edge military confrontation with mainland China , but fundamentally speaking , Taiwan no longer has the strength to fight against mainland China .

If it continues to take its old path of resisting unification through military forces , then it will meet a very tragic ending !

When it comes to the Diaoyu Islands , mainland China and Taiwan can jointly deploy naval vessels , jointly defend the Diaoyu Islands , and join hands in fighting Japan .

Recently , within Taiwan , active actions have been taken concerning the ownership of Taiwan as well .

It is these changes that made the entire Taiwan , from top to bottom , reach a consensus that it can survive by staying close to mainland China .

Facing mainland China 's offensive efforts towards unification , Taiwan can no longer turn back .

Taiwan will become another traitor if it goes into Japan 's embrace . Only by going into mainland China 's embrace will Taiwan have a bright future !

In short , James Soong is merely someone through whom mainland China 's stance ranging from active cooperation to slight warning is demonstrated .

If Ma Ying @-@ jeou does not want to oversleep after going back to bed in the morning , he must truly face what the people of both sides of the Strait have been hoping for for a century !

It is up to him whether he wants to be a sinner of the nation or a meritorious contributor to the nation !

Damn , these people who do n't learn to be good should rot at home . Why are they coming out ?

If you help the other person get up but she does not appreciate it and even pushes you , then you should not help her anymore .

Those who make trouble after getting drunk should be punished without leniency . Detestable

The following is a quote from Qiuyeyuanmaoerkong from the second posting :

The perpetrators are not going to be held responsible just because they said they are poor ! ? Who dares to be a Samaritan in future ! ? ...

The following is a quote from *Miyamiya* from the seventh posting :

Nowadays , one should not do evil , but one should not do good , either

" The society always makes you feel painfully scared . Every day , there always seem to be countless reasons that make people curse ! "

People say , do not do good things . He did n't listen ... sigh ,

The following is a quote from Ninth Inspiration from the tenth posting :

What 's going on ! Damn , these people who do n't learn to be good should rot at home . Why are they coming out ? Endangering the society ! ...

Why did n't they get knocked down by a car and die after getting drunk ? Scumbags !

Good people are beaten into extinction just like this , they 're all done for

Right , you 're so old , why did you go and help a young man up ... It 's tough to be a good person

If severe punishment is not given , in future everyone will pretend to be drunk and make trouble

First of all , I would like to thank a kind @-@ hearted person for calling the police immediately . I would also like to thank the public security authority for the prompt capture of the perpetrators .

Early in the morning on September 1 , my father , as usual , was riding his bicycle to Gucheng Park for exercise . At Jiuli Street , he saw someone lying on the side of the road , and so , out of kindness , he went up to check up on him and ask him to go home soon . Then , three people ran up to him , kicking and beaing him ( according to the police , they had drunk four cases of beer at the time ) . As a result , my father 's skull suffered serious injury . He bled profusely and lost consciousness . By the time he was taken to the hospital , his pupils were already dilated . However , with prompt rescue given by a doctor , he survived . As there was serious bleeding , the doctor performed a life @-@ saving surgery to cut off a piece of skull from my father 's head to remove blood clots . Due to profuse bleeding , some of the blood had already flowed into the brainstem and bottom of the brain , putting his life in danger .

Right now , my father is in very serious condition . On September 1 , he underwent a 5 @-@ hour craniotomy . On September 2 , he had a tracheotomy and a respirator was used to help him breathe . Currently , he is still unconscious . After these few days of hospital treatment , he is sometimes able to move his arms and feet , and he is showing signs of recovery .

As his children , we feel very terrible now . It has been six days since the incident . Under the police 's advice , the perpetrators finally gave 10,000 yuan . We have already delivered the money to the hospital . Now , almost 50,000 yuan has been spent on the medical bills . We do n't know when we can get money to pay for future medical bills .

We have now already received a payment reminder from the hospital . If we do not pay on time , the hospital will stop supplying medications . When that happens , I cannot bear to think of what will happen to my father .

Our family has very poor living conditions . My mother only gets a minimum welfare pay of 380 yuan , and she has diabetes . My father is a retired coking plant worker . His pay is also just a bit over 1,000 yuan . I am doing odd jobs at a factory , and I have not even made any medical insurance or pension contributions . My elder sister is also an odd @-@ job worker . She has also not made any pension or medical insurance contributions . Furthermore , I am going to be a father soon . I have a very heavy family burden . Our family now can only rely on my father 's pay to survive . We absolutely cannot afford such high hospital costs .

It has been six days since the incident . As victims , we have the rights of a citizen to know some things :

1. Where are the perpetrators from ? How are their family and financial conditions ?

3. We hope the perpetrators can cooperate actively and take practical actions to work together to first save my father 's life .

4. We request to meet the parents of the perpetrators .

We hope the news media can help us to jointly save the life of my kind @-@ hearted father .

We also ask the government departments to coordinate with one another and be flexible to activate my father 's medical insurance card and save his life .

A million thanks to the city residents and media for the concern they have shown us in this incident . May all you kind @-@ hearted people have a life of peace !

Why helped him up when he was sleeping happily ?

Faint . The social morality system is about to collapse . Everything must be torn down and start all over again . Sigh

Hope the perpetrators can assume the responsibilities

Nowadays , to be a good person is really not something you can do casually . Hope the perpetrators can assume the responsibilities

Sentence all of them to life imprisonment and let 's see if they are going to pay

Punish severely ! It looks like we have to mind our own business !

Most sunlight issues raised by the elderly men and women are indeed not against the national requirements , so they 're merely unreasonable complaints of the elderly as a result of their perceived discomfort .

Even if there is a court judgment confirming that the developer is not against the law , they will still persist with their unreasonable demands .

Three hours of sunshine is a technical term . Sunlight analysis is needed . Setbacks of spacing are related to not only the sunshine spacing but also the floor thickness . A sunshine spacing coefficient of 1 @:@ 1.4 can meet the requirement for three hours of sunshine on the day of Great Cold in Taizhou . All we want is that the developer does the job legally , and makes it clear that sunshine analysis has shown that the minimum national requirements can be met !

But what you said is also somewhat reasonable . The minimum standards are not acceptable to most people . They have a good reason to ask for more sunlight . However , this developer is too strong . We just want to secure the minimum legitimate interests according to the national regulations , but even that is so difficult for us !

I remain poised

Developers always want to make more money . We have a building here , which has not been pulled down so far even after exposed by CCTV . How powerful the developers are .

All netizens and media are welcome to look into this matter . Let 's see whether it will ultimately be " power over law " or " law over power " for the officials in General Secretary Hu 's hometown when dealing with matters concerning a big developer ! ...

In Zhenjiang , Jiangsu , an old man doing morning exercise helped a drunk man up and was mistaken as a thief and badly beaten up

Mr. Yang , an old man from Zhenjiang who is in his 60 s , was passing by while on his morning exercise . After seeing that , he asked Ji to go home soon , and then held out his hands to help Ji up .

However , Ji mistook Mr. Yang for wanting to steal his things , so immediately together with Wu and Ma , he battered the old man violently till he was seriously injured !

I think they meant to kill him !

Latest news : Victim Mr. Yang passed away around 9 a.m . on 9 @/@ 13 @/@ 2011. Perpetrators remain under criminal detention .

However , this incident has not yet come to a close . The victim 's family may still have to wait for the police to conduct an autopsy on the victim .

First of all , I would like to thank a kind @-@ hearted person for calling the police immediately . I would also like to thank the public security authority for the prompt capture of the perpetrators .

Victim : Old Mr. Yang is currently still unconscious and in critical condition .

The family members of Old Mr. Yang said tearfully that when the old man was being sent to the hospital , his pupils were already dilated . He has been transferred to ICU ( intensive care unit ) after receiving emergency treatment given by the hospital .

the family of Ma recently again raised 10,000 yuan to pay for surgery .

Hereby , we hope the perpetrators will be able to show resolution in taking on responsibilities and face seriously the mistake that has been committed .

Victim 's family : As Old Mr. Yang is still in a toxic and unconscious state , he is unable to provide information about what happened at the time of the incident .

Though the three perpetrators have paid 10,000 yuan compensation in total , it is obviously not enough to pay for the current medical costs that are increasing sharply by the day .

Furthermore , in view of the criminal detention time limit , can such punishment have a deterrent effect on the perpetrators ?

The Yang family hopes to get legal and media assistance .

The moment this incident came out , this writer could not help but recall the " touch porcelain " case that happened two years ago !

Cases like the one where " a vehicle owner who helped an old lady lying on the ground get up was accused of knocking her down " all raised a huge uproar across town .

Sometimes , I even doubt the frequency at which such incidents happen , life is getting to really look like fiction !

The society always makes you feel painfully scared . Every day , there always seem to be countless reasons that make people curse .

Let 's not say much . Let 's pray for the injured and hope the perpetrators get punished .

The perpetrators are not going to be held responsible just because they said they are poor ! ?

Who dares to be a Samaritan in future ?

Let the law show its might~

This is actually not about being a Samaritan or not . Many drunkards have lost their consciousness and will get in a drunken fit .

When you want to help , you have to see who it is . If you can n't handle , just call 120. Sigh ...

Severe punishment still should be given to those who commit crimes after drinking . If not , it will be chaos if everyone pretends to be drunk and bashes up others .

Nowadays , one should not do evil , but one should not do good , either

The old man was looking for trouble . He should have kept a distance after seeing those drunkards .

Here is the thing : Shenzhen Maoye Developer has come to Hailing District , Taizhou City , Jiangsu Province for urban construction , and is welcomed by our people .

We do not oppose the construction of high @-@ rise buildings . However , the developer is going to construct a high @-@ rise building against the law . That is what we are resolutely opposed to !

Maoye Developer has planned a high @-@ rise building of 150 m in the Julangchao lot of the old East Station , Hailing District , Taizhou City .

Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 is just located at the back of the Julangchao lot , and now Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 is only about 100 meters from the external walls of the original buildings at the farthest end of the Julangchao lot .

How does the developer meet the national requirement for building setbacks based on a minimum sunshine spacing of 1 @:@ 1.4 in Taizhou ?

It is certainly not feasible if they want to cheat about the 3 hours technically ,

The plain fact is just in front of us . Moreover , are those few entities the only ones capable of doing sunshine analysis in China ?

If the developer can not even give us owners a minimum of three hours on the day of Great Cold in accordance with the national requirement , which has ensured its best interests , how can it give a reasonable and fair explanation to the society , the vast community of netizens and the masses ?

We understand that the developer wants to get more benefits , but those are supposed to be legitimate benefits !

On the one hand , such act , if illegally infringing upon other people 's interests , will be detrimental to the reputation and long @-@ term future development of the entire Maoye group . On the other hand , are people whose interests are infringed all fools ?

The minimum 3 hours is already difficult to accept . If it is basically an illegal act that makes the fundamental three hours even less , think about it - how will things evolve ?

We hope that the developer can seriously think about this issue , avoid losses and seek its own legal interests through rational development and reasonable development according to law !

If the developer are determined to infringe on our rights and interests , we will surely unite as one to defend our legitimate rights and interests !

The most strange thing is that some people of high rank even agree with the illegal construction of high @-@ rise buildings . We hereby earnestly request the people of high rank who agree with the illegal construction of high @-@ rise buildings to raise their hands and give us a way out !

All netizens and media are welcome to look into this matter . Let 's see whether it will ultimately be " power over law " or " law over power " for the officials in General Secretary Hu 's hometown when dealing with matters concerning a big developer !

All netizens are welcome to look into this matter !

Previously , due to issues about the high @-@ rise buildings on Maoye 's pre @-@ sale renderings and EIA by the Taizhou Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau , the young and old of Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 were neither sleeping nor eating well . Some were depressed , and some were irritated . In short , we felt very angry .

Now Taizhou Municipal Planning Bureau has given us a clear answer that those were simply renderings . Upon verification , the Planning Bureau has requested the developer to make modification . The Bureau will definitely exercise administration according to law , and never approve anything unless it is legal , reasonable and fair ! A forum and a hearing will also be held prior to approval ! A large stone in our hearts has finally dropped onto the ground .

We are moved that in the face of such a huge benefit , our leaders of Taizhou Municipal Government and Taizhou Municipal Planning Bureau have stood unswayed , showing a very noble sentiment and reflecting the characteristics of the Communists in serving the people , which is truly admirable !

All owners of Pengxinlidu Building No. 14 hereby express deep respect and gratitude to Taizhou Municipal Government and Taizhou Municipal Planning Bureau for upholding justice ! People living in Taizhou are happy , thanks to the officials caring for them like their parents !

We thank the government for its concerns over people ! We strongly support for the government administration according to law !

I hope that the developer does not come to compete against us for sunlight . How do we live without sunlight ?

All netizens and media are welcome to look into this matter . Let 's see whether it will ultimately be " power over law " or " law over power " for the officials in General Secretary Hu 's hometown when dealing with matters concerning a big developer ! For us ordinary people who are like dog shit in this society , it is ridiculous to discuss whether power or law is superior .

Yeah , in the real world , we vulnerable groups really feel at a loss as to what to do so often . The power of developers is too great ,

Some relevant government departments just blatantly give the green light to developers against the law and help them fool people !

Is it really capable of restraining developers from grabbing through deceit or by force and illegally obtaining benefits ?

But we can not just watch as the developer take away our sunlight , leaving children and the elderly shivering at home in cold winter . If so , we can n't live a healthy life , nor can we enjoy the warmth of the sun !

Japan had been thinking about invading China for a long time . Would it need the assignment from Russia to decide whether to invade China or not ? Not to mention that the US only acts against the political system of China ? Was it still not enough for Russia to be fooled after 1991?

The weapons market in South Asia has been dominated by the hairy country . Though it is weakened by the US weapons market , however , the Russian weapons market still occupies the major portion .

It is not Russia deliberately making use of countries on the South China Sea to besiege China .

Looking at the chaos in the East China Sea and the South China Sea , even thinking with your ass , you will also know that it is the US rather than Russia trying to cause trouble .

Firstly , Russia is not a country with sea power . It has no interest in intervening and meddling in the issues of the East and South China Seas .

Secondly , at present , with the expansion and extrusion of NATO , Russia can hardly protect its own traditional zone of influence . We can say it is busy enough with its own affairs .

After World War I , two systems had taken place . One is the Versailles System in Europe and the Atlantic , and the other was the US @-@ Japanese Washington System in the Far East and the Pacific .

The US stretches over the two oceans , and controls the two systems at the same time .

After World War II , it took control of the two systems respectively , castrating Germany in Europe , and Japan staying alone in Asia to be hermaphrodites , living on by helping the US manufacture electronics and automobile products .

And now the Asia @-@ Pacific Military Cooperation is setting up a blockage line and a ring of encirclement around the coastal regions in East and South China .

The coup in Central Asia has not succeeded . Otherwise , once the ring of encirclement is completed , the northern land will cause a headache to you just as the East China Sea and the South China Sea .

Do you still believe that China can become a friend of the US as long as it changes its ideology and system ?

The reasons for China to ally with Russia are that both Russia and China need to heal their wounds from after the disintegration of the Soviet Union and with the savage hegemony of the US .

In fact , unlike China , Russia has neither the policy of reform of opening up nor a good future ( this precious opportunity was seized by China at the historical turning point then , while in Russia , it was ruined by the two idiots at the critical moment . It also shows that the Russians are relatively inferior to the Chinese people in terms of both IQ and EQ ) .

The Russians are bare @-@ footed , so they are not afraid of a China with shoes .

China has enough reasons to make concessions to Russia . China has no fear . China has many opportunities and China has other approaches .

Although Russia is not our friend , we should not turn it into an enemy .

To the Chinese people , if Russia wantonly killed Chinese people in China 's traditional area of activities like Japan did , then in the sentiments of ordinary Chinese people , they would hate Russia as much as they hate Japan . However , they did not .

It can even be ignored if compared with the Chinese population of nearly 400 million . Can it be equated with Japan 's massacre of Chinese people in the populated North and Southeast of China ?

If the Russians really want to seriously take China as their arch enemy , they should strive to construct the Far East .

However , nowadays , with its own serious problems , it continues to abandon the Far East and many cities have become heaps of ruins .

The US can pose a greater threat and impact upon China than Russia , especially in the core area of China .

Do you know the theory of sea control ? Nowadays , is there more influence from the US or Russia in the issues of the Taiwan Straits and the South China Sea and the Far East ? It is the US ! This is clear proof !

Do you think that territorial waters are n't territory ? In modern times , the strategic and economic values of territorial waters are much more than those of land territories . One can only become a strong power and have a say in the international community by controlling the sea .

Why was it not China , its neighbor , but instead Great Britain , separated by vast oceans , that made India into a colony ?

Nowadays , Russia has serious problems itself . Its armaments are quite obsolete , and the living conditions for its people are extremely adverse . The population has faced a sharp reduction .

It has become common practice for women to marry foreigners , and many of them come to China and become prostitutes .

Even the productivity of the population is seriously lacking . It is impossible for it to constitute a threat to China .

And nowadays the US is besieging and containing China openly with a view of disrupting China .

Why leave the current problems unsolved , but seize on Russia , which has no ability to pose a threat to China at present ?

When it comes to that Russia occupied China 's territory , that is another story like the Japanese did . Japan wanted to invade the whole country of China , but can Russia do that ?

Russia is a European country with its strategic focus on the west , rather than the Far East . Its expansion to the Far East in history was also partly non @-@ governmental and partly governmental .

Japan is separated from China only by a strait , with the spacious Pacific behind it . There is no menace from the rear if it invades China with all its strength . Can Russia do that ?

Even if Russia puts a little bit more energy into the issues of China and the Far East , can it ignore the affairs in Europe ?

Moreover , we would rather say that Russia has availed itself of opportunities , than to say that it had invaded and occupied China 's territories .

At that time , those places were far away from China 's traditional living area . China 's exploration was a little bit later at that time . There have been few inhabitants around those places in history .

Although when it comes to now , these places are of great economic and strategic importance . However , at that time we did n't discover that ; therefore , at that time even the ruler of China paid no heed to the places , and sent no immigrants there for quite a long time .

Just like today 's oceans . From the perspective of today , they have huge economic values , so territorial waters are also important territories .

However , in the past , they were not discovered . And territorial waters were not regarded as territories . They even exercised trade prohibition on the sea area and closed the coastlines .

Yet the Russians availed themselves of a favorable geological location to occupy those places ahead of us . The Russians were just availing themselves of opportunities .

Other big powers had to capture colonies by war . For example , it was through war that Britain and Japan occupied Hong Kong and Taiwan respectively .

However , the Russians got such a big place without much effort . That was because the ruler of China did n't care for the unexplored places .

However , if it was a place that you did n't send immigrants to explore for a long period throughout history , and was taken by others because of a favorable geographical location and convenient access , then as time goes by it would be hard to say , after a certain length of time .

It would be barely passable for you to claim it to be yours . This is totally different from Japan . Can Russia launch a barbaric war of aggression to occupy China 's imminent territories like Japan did ?

Can it provoke * to invade northeast China and launch an all @-@ out war of aggression against China because northeast China had become an imminent territory of China like northern China with the arrival and exploration of large number of immigrants from inside Shanhaiguan Pass ? It is impossible .

Right now Russia is clamoring " to build India into the top military power in Asia." Putin personally sealed the arms sale deal to sell India advanced weapons such as aircraft carriers , nuclear @-@ powered submarines , T50 fighters and BrahMos missiles ... Even the weapons it sells to Vietnam are more advanced than those it sells to China . And it only sells China big airplanes and carrier aircraft . Its wild ambitions are thoroughly exposed !

It seems that all Chinese hate Japanese , and I am not an exception . However , has everybody thought it over that it was Russia who stirred up the war between China and Japan for fear that China would reclaim territories from it ? It was also Russia that went between the Communist Party and the KMT and was able to achieve success one way or the other . And at the end of the war of resistance , it then stirred up the civil war , and lured China to get involved in the Korean War . If Stalin was still alive , China would have more trouble !

Even if it has propped up an agent in China , it is still concerned about China . And in the 21 st century , it continues to play little tricks of provoking anti @-@ Chinese sentiments . It sold weapons to Vietnam and checked and seized the cargos of Chinese merchants . Its crimes are so numerous that bamboo strips would be exhausted before they could all be recorded .

What is regretful is that our government deals with such kind of things in different ways . If the US or Japan does so , Mr. Qin Gang and Ms. Jiangyu would absolutely deliver a so @-@ called just and severe statement of condemnation . Yet with regard to the incident of the Chinese boatmen who were shot by Russia , there was not even a protest presented . And it became an incident with no definite results in the year 2009 .

The greatest threat of " elimination of the entire race " comes from Japan . The seed of national hatred is indelible . Once discharged accidentally , it would not be just territorial conflicts , but a massacre .

The greatest threat of downfall of D comes from the US . The dramatic contrast of ideology causes the US to treat all dictating Ds in the world as targets to be removed .

The greatest threat to the economy comes from the EU . The EU frequently takes the opportunity of trade or human right conflicts between China and the US to grab a large portion of the market , and squeezes the surplus values . Now it has become our biggest trading partner .

If the Communist Party of China does not put the practical interests of the people first , but continues to tolerate the corrupt governments , the people would lose their faith in the Party , and in the near future it could hardly be avoided that the territories of China would be divided by an alliance of the US and Russia !

It was foreseeable that they have put their hands into our neighboring countries , and they have instigated pressures on our country from all sides . Has n't the government in power run by the Communist Party been claiming to be strong ? And now it is time for you to bring your wisdom into play~

The Sino @-@ Japanese war and the civil war of China were stirred up by Russia , and Russia has the ability to force China to send troops to North Korea ? Nonsense !

For China , China and United States have the biggest relationship in the world , and the Sino @-@ US relationship is a trade @-@ off relationship .

In the most recent visit to the US by Xi Jinping , which is an exercise before he becomes the top official in China , the primary topic discussed was mutually beneficial economic cooperation of the two sides .

Therefore , currently China is playing games with the United States , i.e. how to offset the latter two relationships with economic cooperation .

The biggest puzzle in front of China is how to maintain its relationship with the US as it becomes increasingly powerful .

To China , it cannot fall out with the US .

If China falls out with the US , then it will seriously consumes China 's strengths and will be very unfavorable for future development of China ,

because China will lose the situation of peaceful development internationally , such that China has to cope with not only the powerful military threat posed by the US , but also complicated relations in the neighboring areas . This will seriously consume China energy for development .

Therefore , on the premise of not falling out with the US , China , on the one hand , still has to maintain relationship with the US , while on the other hand , it has to precaution against the dirty tricks that the US plays on China .

Some believe that China should be tough to the US . Is the US someone that yields to hawkishness ?

In the Soviet Union era , it got in a race for hegemony against the US , where both sides were so tough that they became enemies , which provided the US the opportunity to break up thoroughly with the Soviet Union .

As the US does not need the USSR to exist as a great power , the US could attack the USSR and tackle the USSR without any hesitation .

The road China is going along at present is one where the two sides are intertwined with each other , such that the US also suffers great loss when attacking and imposing sanctions on China .

What 's more , many businesspeople in the US also come out to oppose the government 's behaviors . China will be able to truly rise as long as it can keep on for ten years .

As the ancient saying goes , a gentleman can afford to wait for as long as ten years to avenge . If China falls out with the US too early , it will put itself in a very disadvantaged position .

Although we are strong today , it 's not time yet to fight the final battle with the US .

The author believes the two sides could only undergo two phases . The first one is a period which sees China grow in strength and the US feel seriously threatened .

The second stage is when China has become strong , the US is no longer certain about winning a war with China , such that it has no choice than to cooperate in order to obtain more benefits .

To avoid war between China and the US , it appears extremely important to carry out exchanges between the two peoples .

An opinion poll of a US website shows that 6 % of the people believe China and the US are " allies , " 69 % think they are " friendly but not allies , " and 4 % believe they are " enemies ."

Survey results also show that 71 % of the Americans believe Sino @-@ US relations are " very important or somewhat important , " while the proportion is 85 % in opinion leaders .

On the 14 th , the Washington Post said that in an opinion poll it conducted jointly with the American Broadcasting Company , 52 % of the respondents saw China in a negative way .

Second , if China and the US do not handle their relations properly , lacking in communications between its peoples and the foundation or friendship , then the Chinese and American peoples may turn hostile .

Therefore , the Chinese and American peoples must enhance cooperation and bring the two sides closer through economic cooperation , so as to offset the discrepancies brought by military and politics .

So it is no secret to the two sides . Just like Vice President Xi Jinping counts on the US to oppose Taiwan independence and Tibetan , how could China count on a geopolitical enemy ?

National presidents are all masters in politics , who know what 's at stake . However , what should be said should be said . The thing is if the US has said something , it will break its words if it does n't do what it said , which will show to people in the world that the US is immoral and its words do n't count .

It requires wisdom to be friends with an enemy . You can only fight a hundred wars without defeat only if you know yourself and the enemy well .

This view tells us a fact that one will earn respect by developing military force

It requires wisdom to be friends with an enemy . You can only fight a hundred wars without defeat only if you know yourself and the enemy well .

Chairman Mao has said a long time ago : one will be beaten if he @/@ she is backward . Only development is of overriding importance !

I think Taiwan and the mainland are already distinguishing relative superiority or inferiority between them . The thread starter should take a look outside the country more

You look but not see the ZG 's chaos in society , or is it voluntary blindness !

I also feel that there are more modern " traitors of China " than during WWII .

If I take care of myself , that 's good enough , when the country needs me , I 'll be compelled by my sense of righteousness

If these traitors of China existed around 50 , 60 years ago , they would already have been executed by firing squad .

To make a conclusion , you must have something to demonstrate it

I do n't have time to go searching

Their property and families are all outside of the country , of course they will , just like the officials .

when the country needs me , I 'll be compelled by my sense of righteousness

I can just take a look , and dare not to speak my mind , the police can grab people , thread starter , I admire you for daring to speak ! Bump !

The ruling authorities actually should pay attention to these kinds of capitulators and traitors of China !

Comrade Deng Xiaoping once said that the Communist Party will not be overthrown - if it falls , it will be brought down from within the party itself .

Former US Ambassador to China Mr. Huntsman once said in a speech in the US : we will raise eight hundred thousand spokespeople in China , let the Chinese themselves topple China -

and the CIA then used an annual eight million yuan subsidy to help these domestic so @-@ called elite , vowing that they want to let them raise the wind to make waves domestically , citizens definitely need to be alert for this and cannot let outsiders use us .

There are many who have a sense of urgency , quietly watching how things develop , you are dragons coiling , you are tigers crouching , I admire noble @-@ minded patriots .

the ones who are suffering are the ordinary people : even if the body of a salted fish is turned over , it is still a salted fish ...

Freedom of speech\thought , if people express a view somewhat different than the traditional view , and put forward slightly different criticism , then they are called slaves of foreigners , or are accused of reverence for and fascination by foreign things ,

In fact , the US no longer needs to use force to deal with China , they have achieved the result of " defeating enemy soldiers without fighting ".

If things are not seen by eyes and heard by ears yourself , do not assume their existence , three people create a tiger .

Just passing by and taking a look . Won't express my opinion

Some people - do n't forget you are Chinese ; if the country needs me , I 'll be compelled by my sense of righteousness !

I really especially hate those who are eating Chinese things and drinking Chinese things , but who say America is so whatever , those dogs , if America is so good go find your American illegitimate fathers

Patriotism is the bottom line . Everyone must prove worthy of the nation

With the chaos in East and North Africa , we also had no choice but to prevent the running dog traitors from colluding with Western imperialism .

Everything has its set number , it 's not time for a change in the weather in China , traitors can only bark madly like dogs and nothing else , can only make them disappointed .

Freedom of speech is relative . We need take national conditions into account .

Freedom of speech\thought , if people express a view somewhat different than the traditional view , and put forward slightly different criticism , then they are called slaves of foreigners , or are accused of reverence for and fascination by foreign things ,

It can compete with articles from the Cultural Revolution , magnifying a problem to become a question of principle or of ideological line , buttoning the hat .

In fact , US no longer needs to use force to deal with China , they have reached a result of " defeating enemy soldiers without fighting " ...

I have reasons to say this : these last several days I have seen the suggestions given by the experts - with a glimpse I see they are disciples of Wang Jingwei !

Western society allows these people to see the dawn of fairness and justice of democracy .

The domestic political development is truly too slow , being criticized by people whose ideology is a bit advanced is inevitable . Can we blame others for this ?

Some propaganda activities of ZF have soon become viewed as jokes by the people .

The United States ' dream of occupying the whole world has never stopped , it is constantly being planned .

These people may consider themselves to be culture celebrities or may be of high authority and important position , and are distributed in various circles in society , taking great pains to promote American values* and brainwash the Chinese people on behalf of the Americans .

Because these days , I 've been reading part of the " Specialist Professor " blog , it would have been okay if I did n't read it , but after I read it , it made me really surprised .

For example , Assistant Professor Zhang Ming of Renmin University , the political intentions of many of his blogs are extremely obvious .

Such as , in one blog he attributed the reason for the prevalence of hostility in China to elementary school textbooks having " Wang Erxiao ", and he disparaged good articles that promote patriotism as not even worth a penny .

Another example is so @-@ called " sexologist " and " social activist " Li Yinhe - one , her stuff is not similar to things like the treatise " Haite Sexology Report "; two , she has no deep thought ; and three , she has no significant contributions .

She main relies on doing something novel and different and on shocking viewpoints to attract people 's eyes , but without real ability or learning , she 's purely a jumping clown ,

This kind of person puts on the big " specialist " hat just to intimidate people ; the key is that she is concerned about politics yet does n't understand politics , is willing to be a slave of foreigners yet is arrogant and overbearing , is ignorant yet feels fine .

in the essay " China has already become the country which worships money most on the earth ", she attributes Chinese society 's worship of money to atheism ;

the essay " Are you studying Paul or studying Bill ? ", she blathers that " people who study Paul will become terrorists ";

in the essay " Recommendation for establishment of a constitutional court to solve the problem of pornographic products ", she takes citizens publishing pornographic novels to be freedom of speech , and says the Beijing anti @-@ pornography drive is unconstitutional behavior , etc.

Especially today 's masterpiece , " Why is it worth paying such close attention to the Jianghe obscene goods case ? ", where she is once again crying foul over several people suspected of involvement in erotic business activities who are being dealt with by Beijing City , as well as detailing a list of erotic products , with a deeper intent of doing publicity for other people ."

And there is also Sichuanese poet Liu Shahe , who , while America clear to the eye and with swelling gall engages in containment of China and the people of the whole nation are feeling indignant , actually comes out with the fallacy " China and America are friendly ", and tries to pour spirit @-@ confusing soup on the Chinese people willfully and without fear ;

Yi Zhongtian , who got famous by remarking upon the " three countries ", whose talent and learning I have always respected , but I did n't expect that he was actually supporting the big traitor of China , Mao Yushi , saying some things like " I believe whoever disrespects Mao Yushi is not human ", once again making me very much drop my glasses !

Also , as for the rumor on the internet a short time ago " Complete notes on 100 Chinese celebrities who accepted political contributions from the Ford Foundation ", I feel that the segment of the intellectual elite in China who are " becoming treasonous " are increasingly ardent and have already become willful and without fear , to a level of publicly harming the country .

But I do not understand , when these people frequently make treasonous remarks , why no one curbs them and they , moreover , can continue to occupy high positions , calling the wind and rousing the rain among the intelligentsia and in public opinion ?

I remember , 60 @-@ some years ago the US had just fought a war with China , and still threatened China with the use of nuclear weapons ;

40 @-@ some years ago , the US entered Vietnam with the intention of containing China ;

although 32 years ago it had established relations with China , 22 years ago it again started imposing sanctions on China , 12 years ago it bombed a Chinese embassy , 10 years ago the South China Sea collision incident occurred , and two years ago it restarted its containment of China with great fanfare .

Why are there still so many people ignoring their conscience and speaking on the behalf of the US ?

Without taking a big loss , people do n't improve their abilities to remember - this is possibly the greatest weakness of us Chinese .

Mr. Zhengqing , the things you say are quite astonishing , there possibly is a suspicion that there are fragments , even if they are a fifth column , they would n't be so bare @-@ boned , we should allow the existence of different opinions , the times are really different , no matter if its democracy or pan @-@ Occidentalism , neither are beneficial to China , do n't be afraid , what do you say

Love our China , boycott Japanese goods

The Chinese government is incompetent , sooner or later it will collapse !

Give me five hundred thousand elite soldiers and I will make Japan flat in half a year !

China , no matter how much you exercise forbearance , there is nobody who will say good words about you , and others will still bully you as usual

My husband is a veteran . He said if a war takes place , he would stand in the very frontline of the war - rather die on the war field than live on in degradation

The Diaoyu Islands are ours , are n't they ? Um ... Yes , it seems like they were , but now some say they were , some say they were n't . Bit of a mess . Or talk about the matter of development first ?

Oh , yours ? Or his ? Say it , hurry up and say it , shout it out , hurry up and shout the Diaoyu Islands are yours !

Ah , you see you see , they started to catch people , run fast , do n't shout any more , run , beat whoever shouts again .

I 'll ask again whose the Diaoyu Islands are , but do n't shout loud , discuss this matter in a gentlemanly fashion

It should be called , called , called the Senkaku Islands , heh heh the Senkaku Islands , good good , so it seems the Diaoyu Islands issue does not exist any more

Just call them the Senkaku Islands , cheers , for wisely solving the Diaoyu ... ah no , the Senkaku Islands matter , ( ⊙ _ ⊙ )

Who is shouting again outside , go , all disperse , do n't gather and watch any more , things whose nature has been decided , won't be changed any more ?

That is not good . How can we speak in such a untrustworthy manner , we are a responsible big country - let the matter be , do not mention it again , to develop the economy is of overriding importance .

Why are you still not leaving , all of you get out , OK , you won't go , right ? call 110 and have plainclothes police move in , uh . ? Still not dispersed , OK , it seems it won't work if I do n't real weapons , armed police , steel army , come on , if it does n't work , pull out the Third Artillery Troops , fire . .

Sweep the floor sweep the floor we are about to do cleaning , to welcome the next dawn

Dammit ! The Manchu government still charged while holding a kitchen knife ! How about now ? Oh ! Is our ZF protesting ? I believe there are n't any damn Japanese ordinary people who do n't support it . Hey , ZF ! It 's time to wake up . The ordinary people are all making fists ...

1. Establish guaranteed funds , improve working environment and mechanisms , recruit back to China the hundreds of thousands of IT professionals who have emigrated to and linger in the United States and around the world .

4. Accelerate the research and deployment of high @-@ speed intercontinental ballistic missiles which can break missile defense systems and whose range is more than 10,000 nautical miles .

7. Retain 30 strategic nuclear submarines with the ability to inflict three devastating nuclear strikes against enemies .

It does n't matter much when you open your mouth , but how about money , do you really think China is very strong ?

Invade and occupy openly China 's sacred territory , " the Diaoyu Islands ", defying world opinion .

Our China is a country governed with protocol . We do n't want to bother ourselves arguing with the likes of that small country ... really TMD disgusting

Resolutely support the thread starter ! I compose a poem in reply :

Pledge to fight to the death defending the Diaoyu Islands and the related islands

Fleets bumping fishing boats . Little evil Japanese ghosts stirring up trouble and unrest . With hearts of thieves and arrogant form , they again show their wolfish appearance

Never go back to that time , our humiliating appearance when signing the treaties . China be strong , swords be sharp and knives be shining , let 's bury the approaching enemies !

I agree with the analysis of the thread starter , resolutely bump up . If war really comes , I would like to be Hua Mulan , to protect our home and defend our homeland , to spread the prestige of our China , to pledge to fight to the death defending our national dignity .

I very much wish I had been born in those passionate and upsurging times of Mao Zedong , the Long March , losing my head and shedding my blood , completely extinguishing all the enemies that wrong China , spreading our dragon prestige !

My fellow citizens :

Hello , everyone ! We all know the " September 18 th " Incident , but now Japan again has a premeditated plan for another " September 18 th " on the sea , another " Lugou Bridge on the sea ".

Japan surprisingly defied the strong condemnation of the whole world , openly invaded our country 's sacred territory , " the Diaoyu Islands ".

My fellow citizens , ours is ours , what need is there to negotiate ! Japan thus goes even further - wants to create a fact of occupation . Can we allow this ? No - absolutely not !

My fellow citizens , Japan 's militarism has brought the people of Asia grave disasters .

Especially China suffered the ravages of Japan for as long as several decades .

In the Northeast , Japanese Unit 731 cruelly conducted human body experiments on living people of China , Korea and other countries , the method of which were extremely brutal ; the Nanjing Massacre added a layer of blood to the ancient capital which will never fade away ; the big bloody battles at Hengyang and Changsha laid bare the bones of the dead over a thousand kilometers and killed off everything ...

My fellow citizens , of the heinous crimes committed by Japan in China , there are too many instances to cite , difficult to record without exhausting all bamboo strips .

It 's just as if those ten million deceased souls who lost their lives are wandering over the Pacific Ocean , finding it difficult to rest in peace .

All the people who experienced that era must still remember it vividly ; even our younger generations also will cry with tears streaming down our cheeks , and our blood boils with indignation , whenever we turn to this page of history and read !

Now Japan actually wants to reverse the verdict on the history of its aggression - fellow citizens , fellow Chinese in Asia , wake up !

Although it is painful to look back at these hundred years of shame , we must go face it ; although historical issues have not been resolved , let us create and choose history !

Since there is responsibility , we are not afraid . The territory is small , but it is related to the matter of dignity ; no matter how the winds and clouds changes , the interests of the country and national unity are the guarantee of honor ; even though scarred with wounds , we can not let our native lands be separated !

My fellow citizens , for the Chinese nation , the advent of the twenty @-@ first century means a time when we are beset with difficulties inside while being pressed from outside , and we will face many challenges .

What to do , fellow citizens ? Please take a look at the map of the world , that crescent @-@ shaped encirclement is suppressing our breathing , strangling our development , and coveting our national territory .

We do not want to make enemies , but are never afraid of enemies ; we do not want war , but are never afraid of war .

We must urgently arrange arms , strengthen all military forces on land , on sea , and in the air .

Over thousands of years , the Chinese nation has flourished several times , but before it has never had ambition to expand its territory outward .

Not imposing on others what we do n't want ourselves , what we follow is a foreign security strategic philosophy which applies benevolence and virtue .

The tolerance and liberalness of a country are like those of an individual - we avoid hurting others , but must insist on not being hurt ourselves .

Tolerance is certainly not fear , and sincerity does not have to be cowardice .

China exempting Japan from war reparations for World War II was in service of peace , benevolent peace .

My fellow citizens , the People 's Heroes Monument is a condensed history of the Chinese nation striving for continuous self @-@ improvement

The thought @-@ strings of my memory have been agitated from time to time - many heroic , stirring , and tragic scenes of shining spears and armored horses spring up in my mind .

My thoughts go through those yellowing pages of history , as if I saw Emperor Kangxi , the famous ruler of a generation , contemplating alone about how to achieve unification of the territory in his audience hall , hundreds of years ago ; also as if I saw Abraham Lincoln , former U.S. President , wandering alone in the dark of a great hall , thinking about the integrity of the Union .

" Although it is peaceful throughout the world , it is certainly dangerous to forget war ! " My fellow citizens , we want development and peace , but we must never exercise forbearance blindly . The " Boxer Protocol " of national betrayal and humiliation has aggravated China 's poverty and backwardness in modern time - falling behind will lead to being bullied .

We must focus on national defense education , build up a Great Wall in the hearts of 1.3 billion people , and must establish the full range of a national defense system having the ability to both attack and defend ;

The best defense is to attack - we should strengthen forces which can engage in ultra @-@ long @-@ range attack , improve combat capability throughout all of aerospace , of great depth , and over great distances . On the premise of avoiding influence on national economic development , increase investment and construction of the defense industry , accelerate modernization and internationalization of military equipment , and establish a high @-@ quality , high @-@ tech elite division .

The battle horn is about to sound , the people are already fully equipped and ready to go .

Without the people 's support we will accomplish nothing ; with the support of the people , we will be all @-@ powerful .

My fellow citizens , it is time for us to say " no " to others . Therefore , we must achieve :

1. Establish guaranteed funds , improve working environment and mechanisms , recruit back to China the hundreds of thousands of IT professionals who have emigrated to and linger in the United States and around the world .

4. Accelerate the research and deployment of high @-@ speed intercontinental ballistic missiles which can break missile defense systems and whose range is more than 10,000 nautical miles .

6. Retain 1000 nuclear bombs equivalent to ten million tons of TNT , and when necessary , install nuclear warheads on all short @- and middle @-@ range missiles .

7. Retain 30 strategic nuclear submarines with the ability to inflict three devastating nuclear strikes against enemies .

My fellow citizens , only if we have self @-@ confidence and self @-@ improvement , can we strive to be strong . Qin Shi Huang unified China . Zheng Chenggong recovered Taiwan . In our responsibilities we must carry on the farsightedness , insight , and strong will of our predecessors .

Now , that piece of land trembling far away from the embrace of the motherland is shaking , moaning , and calling . Fellow citizens , let us carry forward the unfulfilled wishes of previous generals , moving forward courageously !

When reading over history , the heaviness and anger in my heart simmer into concern for the nation . Although I was born to cloth gown and am one of the common people , for the prosperity of the motherland , for the motherland being splendid once again , I am willing to voluntarily serve our country , and I will have no regrets even if I die ! My sincere patriotic heart is adequate to show to heaven !

Here , I 've composed a poem in classical ci form , to voice the aspirations of my heart .

Bitterly lost our Ryukyu Islands

Brandish our weapons and cross to the east

Other articles : " A book for Taiwan compatriots @-@ I have a dream ", " The necessity for building memorials museums or temples for Chinese national heroes ", " How long will we tolerate it ", " China is expecting the Olympics , but would never beg for the Olympics ", " If we forget the hardship of history , there will be more history of hardship ", " I am Chinese ", " There is only one Chinese nation , there is only one Chinese culture ", " With the over @-@ development of sports , the state may decline ", "' Wealthy country , strong people ' or ' wealthy officials , poor people "?", " Disgusting Ren Zhiqiang , shut your filthy mouth ", " Hateful housing prices ! Pitiable people !

", " Contemporary garbage writer , shameless Li Yinhe , please let the children off the hook "

It is time to show our strength ! China has been calm for too long !

Now we already have no cohesion ! China needs to start a war ! A harsh slap in the face of the countries which follow the United States ' rear !

Let them know that the US is not a panacea ! If we win , it may increase China 's influence ! and improve the cohesion of the citizenry ! If we lose , we can clean out those incompetent bureaucrats , and make those trash get out ! Let China have new blood and get updated . , Get up , China !

I suggest that China strengthens the guard on the Diaoyu Islands , make it daily , protect the fishermen and the sovereignty of our country ; if Japan dares to invade our territory with military force , we will fight a small @-@ scale war of self @-@ defense , regardless of the cost . China can not lose !

They want money , not the face

Have a look at the " wolf with glasses " near Ms. Fan , you will know the actress has no choice but drink with him or she will be forced out or even framed .

No one is easy . Life is like a show , you must have a look at the script to know how to perform

Everybody is doing this , how can you make money if you do n't do this

She is a proud woman in front of others but is in melancholy mood when staying alone ...

To put it plainly stars nowadays are just popular prostitutes in ancient times . Now that they are famous prostitutes , it should be just normal to drink with some high officials or even sleep with them

Stop talking about others just behave yourself

It 's not so bad , they 're just playing in their own circle , out of sight , out of mind ,

Not like the old guy Zhang Jizhong not only behaved like a hooligan in his own circle , but also thinks he is virtuous without any talent . He makes TV series when he has nothing to do to wreck people of the whole country .

Both take what they need

A story is now very shocking in the entertainment world . It is rumored that Hsu Yuki has been forced out because she refused to drink with a guest as arranged by the company and has to switch to work as a lawyer 's assistant instead to make ends meet .

Much envied super stars often encounter social engagements or circumstances which they do n't welcome but have to join in ,

After all , there are many things they can n't decide themselves ' cause that will have to do with many aspects and the interests of many people ,

Sometimes a dinner party which seems very normal for us ordinary people may not be that simple for stars as we imagined .

A star will have lots of contracts and her source of money will be rolling if she tackles well ; If she does n't tack well , what comes after her heel would be forcing out or even frame @-@ ups ...

There are two kinds of smart female stars . Those of the first kind always hold very high integrity and sternly reject all such invitations ;

the second kind are good at playing the trick and making their objectives achieved with their seed money ,

It 's rumored that even some super female stars won their first roles in this way .

After drinking some alcohol , the advertiser or show sponsor may take the chance to lie on the female star 's shoulder , feel her chin or kiss her cheek , and endurance is the attitude most adopted by the female stars .

Those stars are just pretending , they are all actually living a much damned better life than this

The women are birds and beasts , and the men are worse than birds and beasts
